Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in June indicates 
that the labor market remains strong and that economic activity has been rising at a moderate 
rate.  Job gains have been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has 
remained low.  Although growth of household spending has picked up from earlier in the year, 
growth of business fixed investment has been soft.  On a 12-month basis, overall inflation and 
inflation for items other than food and energy are running below 2 percent.  Market-based 
measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation 
expectations are little changed. 
Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum 
employment and price stability.  In light of the implications of global developments for the 
economic outlook as well as muted inflation pressures, the Committee decided to lower the 
target range for the federal funds rate to 2 to 2-1/4 percent.  This action supports the Committee’s 
view that sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation 
near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective are the most likely outcomes, but 
uncertainties about this outlook remain.  As the Committee contemplates the future path of the 
target range for the federal funds rate, it will continue to monitor the implications of incoming 
information for the economic outlook and will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion, with a 
strong labor market and inflation near its symmetric 2 percent objective. 
In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal 
funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its 
maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective.  This 
assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor 
market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on 
financial and international developments.

Rosengren, who preferred at this meeting to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 
2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent.

Decisions Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation 

The Federal Reserve has made the following decisions to implement the monetary policy stance 
announced by the Federal Open Market Committee in its statement on July 31, 2019: 

• The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to lower 
the interest rate paid on required and excess reserve balances to 2.10 percent, 
effective August 1, 2019.    
• As part of its policy decision, the Federal Open Market Committee voted to authorize 
and direct the Open Market Desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until 
instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Open Market Account in 
accordance with the following domestic policy directive: 

“Effective August 1, 2019, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk 
to undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds 
rate in a target range of 2 to 2-1/4 percent, including overnight reverse repurchase 
operations (and reverse repurchase operations with maturities of more than one 
day when necessary to accommodate weekend, holiday, or similar trading 
conventions) at an offering rate of 2.00 percent, in amounts limited only by the 
value of Treasury securities held outright in the System Open Market Account 
that are available for such operations and by a per-counterparty limit of 
$30 billion per day. 

Effective August 1, 2019, the Committee directs the Desk to roll over at auction 
all principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities 
and to reinvest all principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of 
agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities received during each 
calendar month.  Principal payments from agency debt and agency mortgage-
backed securities up to $20 billion per month will be reinvested in Treasury 
securities to roughly match the maturity composition of Treasury securities 
outstanding; principal payments in excess of $20 billion per month will continue 
to be reinvested in agency mortgage-backed securities.  Small deviations from 
these amounts for operational reasons are acceptable.   

The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap 
transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve’s agency 
mortgage-backed securities transactions.”

In a related action, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted 
unanimously to approve a 1/4 percentage point decrease in the primary credit rate to 
2.75 percent, effective August 1, 2019.  In taking this action, the Board approved 
requests to establish that rate submitted by the Boards of Directors of the Federal 
Reserve Banks of Philadelphia, Chicago, St. Louis, Dallas, and San Francisco. 

This information will be updated as appropriate to reflect decisions of the Federal Open Market 
Committee or the Board of Governors regarding details of the Federal Reserve’s operational 
tools and approach used to implement monetary policy.
