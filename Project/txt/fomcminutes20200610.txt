The Chair opened the meeting with an acknowledgment 
of the extraordinary and deeply troubling events of the 
last two weeks.  Injustice, prejudice, and the callous dis-
regard for life had led to social unrest and a sense of des-
pair.  The Chair noted that it was incumbent upon the 
leaders of the Federal Reserve System to continue to 
communicate with force and clarity about the Federal 
Reserve’s core values, and to reaffirm its unflinching 
commitment to those values in pursuing the Federal Re-
serve’s mandated goals.  In that spirit, the Chair noted 
that he intended to offer the following remarks at the

end of the postmeeting press conference.  All partici-
pants supported the statement affirming the Federal Re-
serve’s core values and its commitment to do everything 
it can to foster racial equality as well as diversity and in-
clusion both within the Federal Reserve System and in 
society more broadly. 
I want to acknowledge the tragic events that 
have again put a spotlight on the pain of racial 
injustice in this country.  The Federal Reserve 
serves the entire nation.  We operate in, and are 
part of, many of the communities across the 
country where Americans are grappling with 
and expressing themselves on issues of racial 
equality. 
I speak for my colleagues throughout the Fed-
eral Reserve System when I say that there is no 
place at the Federal Reserve for racism, and 
there should be no place for it in our society.  
Everyone deserves the opportunity to partici-
pate fully in our society and in our economy. 
These foundational principles guide us in all we 
do, from monetary policy to our focus on diver-
sity and inclusion in our workplace, and to our 
work regulating and supervising banks to ensure 
fair access to credit around the country.  We will 
take this opportunity to renew our steadfast 
commitment to these principles, making sure 
that we are playing our part.   
We understand that the work of the Federal Re-
serve touches communities, families, and busi-
nesses across the country.  Everything we do is 
in service to our public mission.  We are com-
mitted to using our full range of tools to support 
the economy and to help assure that the recov-
ery from this difficult period will be as robust as 
possible. 

Discussion of Forward Guidance, Asset Purchases, 
and Yield Curve Caps or Targets 

Participants discussed tools for conducting monetary 
policy when the federal funds rate is at its effective lower 
bound (ELB).  The discussion addressed two topics: 
(1) the roles of forward guidance and large-scale asset 
purchase programs in supporting the attainment of the 
Committee’s maximum-employment and price-stability 
goals and (2) in light of the foreign and historical expe-
rience with approaches that cap or target interest rates 
along the yield curve, whether such approaches could be 
used to support forward guidance and complement asset 
purchase programs.  The staff briefing on the first topic 

focused on outcome-based forward guidance for the 
federal funds rate—which ties changes in the target 
range for the federal funds rate to the achievement of 
specified macroeconomic outcomes, such as reaching a 
given level of the unemployment rate or inflation—and 
asset purchase programs of the kind used during and fol-
lowing the previous recession.  The staff presented re-
sults from model simulations that suggested that for-
ward guidance and large-scale asset purchases can help 
support the labor market recovery and the return of in-
flation to the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent inflation 
goal.  The simulations suggested that the Committee 
would have to maintain highly accommodative financial 
conditions for many years to quicken meaningfully the 
recovery from the current severe downturn.  The brief-
ing addressed factors that might alter the potency of for-
ward guidance and asset purchase programs, along with 
a number of considerations for the design of these ac-
tions.  The staff cautioned that businesses and house-
holds might not be as forward looking as assumed in the 
model simulations, which could reduce the effectiveness 
of policies that are predicated on influencing expecta-
tions about the path of policy several years into the fu-
ture.  Alternatively, prompt and forceful policy actions 
by the Committee might help focus the public’s expec-
tations around better outcomes or reduce perceived risks 
of worst-case scenarios, which could generate more im-
mediate macroeconomic benefits than those featured in 
the staff analysis.   
The second staff briefing reviewed the yield caps or tar-
gets (YCT) policies that the Federal Reserve followed 
during and after World War II and that the Bank of Ja-
pan and the Reserve Bank of Australia are currently em-
ploying.  These three experiences illustrated different 
types of YCT policies:  During World War II, the Fed-
eral Reserve capped yields across the curve to keep 
Treasury borrowing costs low and stable; since 2016, the 
Bank of Japan has targeted the 10-year yield to continue 
to provide accommodation while limiting the potential 
for an excessive flattening of the yield curve; and, since 
March 2020, the Reserve Bank of Australia has targeted 
the three-year yield, a target that is intended to reinforce 
the bank’s forward guidance for its policy rate and to in-
fluence funding rates across much of the Australian 
economy.  The staff noted that these three experiences 
suggested that credible YCT policies can control govern-
ment bond yields, pass through to private rates, and, in 
the absence of exit considerations, may not require large 
central bank purchases of government debt.  But the 
staff also highlighted the potential for YCT policies to 
require the central bank to purchase very sizable

amounts of government debt under certain circum-
stances—a potential that was realized in the U.S. experi-
ence in the 1940s—and the possibility that, under YCT 
policies, monetary policy goals might come in conflict 
with public debt management goals, which could pose 
risks to the independence of the central bank.   
In their discussion of forward guidance and large-scale 
asset purchases, participants agreed that the Committee 
has had extensive experience with these tools, that they 
were effective in the wake of the previous recession, that 
they have become key parts of the monetary policy 
toolkit, and that, as a result, they have important roles to 
play in supporting the attainment of the Committee’s 
maximum-employment and price-stability goals.  Vari-
ous participants noted that the economy is likely to need 
support from highly accommodative monetary policy 
for some time and that it will be important in coming 
months for the Committee to provide greater clarity re-
garding the likely path of the federal funds rate and asset 
purchases.  Participants generally indicated support for 
outcome-based forward guidance.  A number of partici-
pants spoke favorably of forward guidance tied to infla-
tion outcomes that could possibly entail a modest tem-
porary overshooting of the Committee’s longer-run in-
flation goal but where inflation fluctuations would be 
centered on 2 percent over time.  They saw this form of 
forward guidance as helping reinforce the credibility of 
the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent inflation objective 
and potentially preventing a premature withdrawal of 
monetary policy accommodation.  A couple of partici-
pants signaled a preference for forward guidance tied to 
the unemployment rate, noting that it would be more 
credible to focus on labor market outcomes that have 
been achieved in the recent past or that—given how 
high the unemployment rate currently is—such guidance 
would clearly signal a high degree of accommodation for 
an extended period.  A few others suggested that  
calendar-based guidance—which specifies a date beyond 
which accommodation could start to be reduced—might 
be at least as effective as outcome-based guidance.  They 
noted that calendar-based guidance had been very effec-
tive when the Committee used it in 2011 and 2012 or 
that it would be very challenging to provide credible out-
come-based guidance in light of the substantial uncer-
tainty surrounding the current economic outlook.  Re-
gardless of the specific form of forward guidance, a cou-
ple of participants expressed the concern that policies 
that effectively committed the Committee to maintain-
ing very low interest rates for a long time could ulti-
mately pose significant risks to financial stability.   

Participants agreed that asset purchase programs can 
promote accommodative financial conditions by putting 
downward pressure on term premiums and longer-term 
yields.  Several participants remarked that declines in the 
neutral rate of interest and in term premiums over the 
past decade and prevailing low levels of longer-term 
yields would likely act as constraints on the effectiveness 
of asset purchases in the current environment and noted 
that these constraints were not as acute when the Com-
mittee implemented such programs in the wake of the 
Global Financial Crisis.  These participants noted, how-
ever, that large-scale asset purchases could still be bene-
ficial under current circumstances by offsetting potential 
upward pressures on longer-term yields or by helping re-
inforce the Committee’s commitment to maintaining 
highly accommodative financial conditions.  A few par-
ticipants questioned the desirability of large-scale asset 
purchases following the current purchases to support 
market functioning, noting that they likely would lead to 
a further considerable expansion of the Federal Re-
serve’s balance sheet or have potentially adverse impli-
cations for financial stability. 
In their discussion of the foreign and historical experi-
ence with YCT policies and the potential role for such 
policies in the United States, nearly all participants indi-
cated that they had many questions regarding the costs 
and benefits of such an approach.  Among the three ep-
isodes discussed in the staff presentation, participants 
generally saw the Australian experience as most relevant 
for current circumstances in the United States.  None-
theless, many participants remarked that, as long as the 
Committee’s forward guidance remained credible on its 
own, it was not clear that there would be a need for the 
Committee to reinforce its forward guidance with the 
adoption of a YCT policy.  In addition, participants 
raised a number of concerns related to the implementa-
tion of YCT policies, including how to maintain control 
of the size and composition of the Federal Reserve’s bal-
ance sheet, particularly as the time to exit from such pol-
icies nears; how to combine YCT policies—which at 
least in the Australian case incorporate aspects of date-
based forward guidance—with the types of outcome-
based forward guidance that many participants favored; 
how to mitigate the risks that YCT policies pose to cen-
tral bank independence; and how to assess the effects of 
these policies on financial market functioning and the 
size and composition of private-sector balance sheets.  A 
number of participants commented on additional chal-
lenges associated with YCT policies focused on the 
longer portion of the yield curve, including how these 
policies might interact with large-scale asset purchase 

Page 4Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ 
 
programs and the extent of additional accommodation 
they would provide in the current environment of very 
low interest rates.  Some of these participants also noted 
that longer-term yields are importantly influenced by 
factors such as longer-run inflation expectations and the 
longer-run neutral real interest rate and that changes in 
these factors or difficulties in estimating them could re-
sult in the central bank inadvertently setting yield caps or 
targets at inappropriate levels.  A couple of participants 
remarked that an appropriately designed YCT policy that 
focused on the short-to-medium part of the yield curve 
could serve as a powerful commitment device for the 
Committee.  These participants noted that, even if mar-
ket participants currently expect the federal funds rate to 
remain at its ELB through the medium term, the intro-
duction of an effective YCT policy could help prevent 
those expectations from changing prematurely—as hap-
pened during the previous recovery—or that the size of 
a large-scale asset purchase program, which also poses 
risks to central bank independence, could be reduced by 
an effective YCT policy.  All participants agreed that it 
would be useful for the staff to conduct further analysis 
of the design and implementation of YCT policies as 
well as of their likely economic and financial effects. 
A number of participants emphasized that, when as-
sessing the potential roles that different monetary policy 
tools might play to support the attainment of the Com-
mittee’s goals, it was important to think about how var-
ious policy tools could be used in coordination as part 
of the Committee’s overall strategy to achieve its dual-
mandate objectives.  In addition, various participants 
noted that clear communications with the public are cen-
tral to the efficacy of all policy tools and that, therefore, 
the Committee should complete its monetary policy 
framework review in the near term, including revising 
the Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Pol-
icy Strategy.  Such a revised statement would communi-
cate to the public how the Committee views its policy 
goals and provide additional context to the Committee’s 
policy actions. 

Developments in Financial Markets and Open Mar-
ket Operations 

The System Open Market Account (SOMA) manager 
first discussed developments in financial markets over 
the intermeeting period.  Risk asset prices were buoyed 
by optimism about the potential for increased economic 
activity associated with reopenings as parts of the United 
States and other countries relaxed lockdown restrictions.  
That optimism was reinforced by high-frequency data 
suggesting a pickup in economic activity.  Market partic-
ipants also pointed to the suite of U.S. and global policy 

measures taken since mid-March as laying a foundation 
for the improvement in risk sentiment.  Against this 
backdrop, staff analysis suggested that equity prices had 
been supported by expectations for a strong rebound in 
earnings next year, low risk-free rates and positive risk 
sentiment.  Despite this improvement in risk sentiment, 
market participants expected weak overall growth in 
2020, and elevated uncertainties in the outlook re-
mained.  The manager noted that prospects for adverse 
developments regarding the coronavirus (COVID-19) 
and the potential for financial strains to amplify reces-
sionary dynamics, and geopolitical developments, in-
cluding renewed U.S.–China tensions, presented near 
term risks to financial markets.  Market participants were 
also attentive to the recent steepening in the Treasury 
yield curve and noted a range of uncertainties in the out-
look for longer-term rates. 
Regarding expectations for monetary policy, respond-
ents to the Open Market Trading Desk’s surveys sug-
gested that most market participants did not anticipate 
policy changes at the June meeting. The target range for 
the federal funds rate was expected to remain at the ELB 
for at least the next couple of years, although many sur-
vey respondents attached some probability to the target 
range increasing in 2022.  Although the rates implied by 
federal funds futures contracts settling next year had 
fallen to slightly negative levels in May, survey respond-
ents attached very little probability to the possibility of 
negative policy rates.   
The manager turned to a discussion of Federal Reserve 
operations.  Credit facilities, some of which became op-
erational over the period, generally experienced modest 
activity in light of broad improvements in credit market 
conditions.  New usage across many funding operations 
and facilities had declined over the intermeeting period 
as conditions in funding markets improved.  The man-
ager noted that a significant proportion of amounts out-
standing under U.S. dollar liquidity swaps and repur-
chase agreements (repo) reflected term transactions ini-
tiated during the period of funding market strains.  In 
light of the improvement in funding market conditions, 
the manager noted that it might be appropriate to make 
a modest adjustment to the minimum bid rates on repo 
operations in the forthcoming calendar, which would ef-
fectively position these operations in a backstop role.  
These adjustments were not expected to have any signif-
icant effects in short-term funding markets. 
Finally, the manager discussed the near-term plans for 
purchases of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-
backed securities (MBS).  Overall, functioning in the 

Minutes of the Meeting of June 9–10, 2020Page 5_____________________________________________________________________________________________ 
 
markets for these securities had improved substantially.  
In light of these improvements, the Desk had gradually 
reduced the pace of purchases over the intermeeting pe-
riod, to their current levels of $4 billion per day in Treas-
ury securities and $4.5 billion per day in agency MBS.  
These purchase amounts were significantly lower than 
the peak pace in mid-March and roughly corresponded 
to monthly increases in SOMA holdings of approxi-
mately $80 billion in Treasury securities and $40 billion 
in agency MBS.    Continuing to increase holdings at this 
pace would likely help sustain the improvements in mar-
ket functioning, and seemed to be roughly in line with 
market expectations for Treasury purchases, and toward 
the lower end of expectations for agency MBS pur-
chases, net of reinvestments.  In addition, principal pay-
ments from agency debt and agency MBS held in the 
SOMA portfolio could continue to be reinvested in 
agency MBS.  Weekly operations in agency commercial 
mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) would also be con-
ducted.  The Desk was prepared to increase the size or 
adjust the composition of Treasury, agency MBS and 
agency CMBS purchases as needed to sustain smooth 
market functioning in the markets for these securities.  
By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s 
domestic transactions over the intermeeting period.  
There were no intervention operations in foreign curren-
cies for the System’s account during the intermeeting pe-
riod. 

Staff Review of the Economic Situation 

The coronavirus outbreak and the measures undertaken 
to contain its spread were severely disrupting economic 
activity in the United States and abroad.  The available 
information for the June 9–10 meeting suggested that 
U.S. real gross domestic product (GDP) would likely 
post a historically large decline in the second quarter.  
Labor market conditions improved in May, but these im-
provements were modest relative to the substantial de-
terioration seen over the previous two months.  Con-
sumer price inflation, as measured by the 12-month per-
centage change in the price index for personal consump-
tion expenditures (PCE), slowed notably through April, 
reflecting the effects of both weak aggregate demand 
and low energy prices. 
Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded strongly in 
May, though by much less than the historic job losses 
recorded in April.  The unemployment rate moved down 
to 13.3 percent in May after soaring to 14.7 percent in 
April.  As was highlighted by the Bureau of Labor Sta-
tistics, these figures likely understated the extent of un-
employment; accounting for the unusually large number 

of workers who reported themselves as employed but 
absent from their jobs would have raised the unemploy-
ment rate by 5 percentage points in April and 3 percent-
age points in May.  Both the labor force participation 
rate and the employment-to-population ratio increased 
in May.  Initial claims for unemployment insurance ben-
efits had declined through the last week of May from 
their peak in late March, but they still were at a histori-
cally elevated level.  Average hourly earnings for all em-
ployees declined in May after rising sharply in April, but 
these fluctuations 
largely reflected the substantial 
changes in the level and composition of employment, 
which disproportionately affected lower-wage workers.  
The employment cost index for total labor compensa-
tion in the private sector increased 2.8 percent over the 
12 months ending in March—a period mostly predating 
the onset of the pandemic—and was the same as its year-
earlier pace. 
Total PCE price inflation was only 0.5 percent over the 
12 months ending in April, reflecting both weak aggre-
gate demand in recent months and a considerable drop 
in consumer energy prices.  Prices fell in March and 
April in many categories that were affected the most by 
social-distancing measures, such as the prices for air 
travel and hotel accommodations.  Core PCE price in-
flation, which excludes changes in consumer food and 
energy prices, was 1.0 percent over the 12 months end-
ing in April.  In contrast, the trimmed mean measure of 
12-month PCE price inflation constructed by the Fed-
eral Reserve Bank of Dallas was 1.9 percent in April.  
The consumer price index (CPI) inched up 0.1 percent 
over the 12 months ending in May, while core CPI infla-
tion was 1.2 percent over the same period.  Recent read-
ings on survey-based measures of longer-run inflation 
expectations were little changed on balance.  The Uni-
versity of Michigan Surveys of Consumers measure for 
the next 5 to 10 years edged up in May, while the 3-year-
ahead measure from the Federal Reserve Bank of New 
York’s Survey of Consumer Expectations was un-
changed.  The 10-year measure for PCE price inflation 
from the Survey of Professional Forecasters ticked down 
in the second quarter.  All of these measures of longer-
run inflation expectations continued to be near their re-
cent ranges. 
Real PCE slumped in April, with declines widespread 
across most spending categories.  In May, however, light 
motor vehicle sales and some other high-frequency indi-
cators of consumer spending turned up, but the levels of 
these indicators were mostly still below their levels early 
in the year.  Real disposable personal income increased 
significantly in April, as a marked decline in wage and 

Page 6Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ 
 
salary income was more than offset by a substantial 
boost from government transfer payments due to recent 
fiscal policy support; as a result, the personal saving rate 
soared.  The consumer sentiment measures from both 
the Michigan survey and the Conference Board survey 
crept up in May but remained below their levels early in 
the year.   
Real residential investment appeared to be weakening 
significantly in the second quarter.  Starts and building 
permit issuance for single-family homes, along with 
starts of multifamily units, dropped sharply in April.  
Sales of existing homes contracted markedly in April, al-
though new home sales edged up. 
Real business fixed investment continued to tumble in 
the second quarter.  Nominal new orders and shipments 
of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft decreased 
considerably in April.  Nominal business spending for 
nonresidential structures outside of the drilling and min-
ing sector also fell in April.  In addition, the effects of 
low crude oil prices were evident in further declines in 
the number of crude oil and natural gas rigs in operation 
through early June, an indicator of business spending on 
structures in the drilling and mining sector. 
Total industrial production plunged in April, as many 
factories slowed or suspended operation in response to 
the coronavirus pandemic.  The decline in manufactur-
ing production was widespread across all major indus-
tries and was led by a collapse in the output of motor 
vehicles and related parts.  Output in the mining sec-
tor—which includes crude oil extraction—also de-
creased, reflecting the effects of low crude oil prices.  
Total real government purchases appeared to be rising 
moderately in the second quarter.  Federal defense 
spending continued to increase in April, and nondefense 
purchases were likely to be boosted in the second quar-
ter by recent fiscal policy measures related to the coro-
navirus.  In contrast, state and local purchases looked to 
be declining, as the payrolls of these governments shrank 
in April and May, and nominal state and local construc-
tion expenditures decreased in April.  
The nominal U.S. international trade deficit widened in 
both March and April, as exports of goods and services 
plunged more than imports.  The fall in goods exports 
was broad based, with particularly sharp declines in au-
tomotive products, industrial supplies, and capital 
goods.  Goods imports also contracted significantly in 
most categories through April, and a near halt of inter-
national travel drove a steep decline in exports and im-
ports of services.   

Foreign economic activity contracted in the first quarter, 
even though most countries abroad introduced strict  
social-distancing measures to contain the spread of the 
coronavirus only toward the end of the quarter.  In 
China, where restrictions were largely lifted by the end 
of the first quarter, data pointed to a relatively quick re-
bound in economic activity in the second quarter.  Out-
side of China, indicators suggested that foreign eco-
nomic activity plummeted further in the second quarter, 
notwithstanding some signs of improvement in May as 
restrictions started to ease.  Inflation rates fell sharply 
across most foreign economies in April and May.  The 
low level of oil prices relative to a year ago contributed 
to 12-month inflation rates close to or below zero in 
many advanced foreign economies (AFEs).   

Staff Review of the Financial Situation 

Over the intermeeting period, risk sentiment improved, 
on net, as optimism over reopening the economy, po-
tential coronavirus treatments, the unexpectedly positive 
May employment situation report, and other indicators 
that suggest that economic activity may be rebounding 
more than offset concerns arising from otherwise dire 
economic data releases, warnings from health experts 
that openings may have been premature, and renewed 
tensions between the United States and China.  Equity 
prices rose, and corporate bond spreads narrowed nota-
bly.  The Treasury yield curve steepened, and the market-
implied expected path of the federal funds rate declined 
somewhat.  Liquidity conditions continued to improve 
in general, but some stress was still evident in several 
markets.  Financing conditions were still somewhat 
strained for lower-rated borrowers and small businesses 
even as announcements and implementation of Federal 
Reserve facilities during the intermeeting period were 
supportive of credit flows.  The credit quality of busi-
nesses and municipal debt weakened. 
The expected path of the federal funds rate for the next 
few years, based on a straight read of overnight index 
swap quotes, declined a bit and remained close to the 
ELB through late 2023.  Market-implied forward rates 
referring to 2021 and 2022 turned slightly negative for a 
few days beginning on May 7, though market commen-
tary suggested that this development did not reflect in-
vestors expecting the FOMC to lower the federal funds 
rate target range below zero.  This view was supported 
by Federal Reserve communications that negative inter-
est rates did not appear to be an attractive policy tool.   
The Treasury yield curve steepened over the intermeet-
ing period, with 2-year yields little changed while 10- and 
30-year yields rose.  Longer-term yields were likely 

Minutes of the Meeting of June 9–10, 2020Page 7_____________________________________________________________________________________________ 
 
boosted by expectations of heavy upcoming Treasury se-
curity issuance as well as some unwinding of safe-haven 
demands in connection with improved investor senti-
ment.  The Treasury’s first 20-year bond offering since 
1986 was met with solid demand.  Changes in inflation 
compensation based on Treasury Inflation-Protected 
Securities yields were mixed; 5-year inflation compensa-
tion rose amid the recent partial rebound in crude oil 
prices, while the 5-to-10-year measure edged down.  At 
the end of the intermeeting period, both measures stood 
roughly halfway between their mid-March lows and typ-
ical levels seen in recent years.   
Broad stock price indexes moved higher.  One-month 
implied volatility on the S&P 500 index declined some-
what but still stood at the 85th percentile of its distribu-
tion since 1990. 
 Spreads on 
investment- and  
speculative-grade corporate bonds over comparable- 
maturity Treasury yields narrowed considerably but re-
mained at levels similar to those in other periods of no-
table economic or bond market stress, though well be-
low financial crisis levels. 
Over the intermeeting period, financial market function-
ing appeared to improve in general, although progress 
was uneven.  Liquidity measures improved in the Treas-
ury market, but off-the-run Treasury securities of all ten-
ors and longer-maturity on-the-run securities remained 
less liquid than before the onset of the pandemic.  
Agency MBS market functioning had largely recovered, 
except for some less liquid parts of the market.  Corpo-
rate bond market liquidity improved considerably but re-
mained somewhat strained, particularly for speculative-
grade bonds.  Liquidity in the municipal bond markets 
was still below pre-pandemic levels. 
Conditions in unsecured short-term funding markets 
continued to improve over the intermeeting period, and 
spreads on most types of commercial paper and negotia-
ble certificates of deposit narrowed to levels that ap-
proached pre-pandemic ranges.  Amid better market 
conditions, take-up in the emergency liquidity facilities 
declined substantially.  Heavy demand for Treasury bills 
from money market funds held down rates despite an 
unprecedented pace of issuance.  The effective federal 
funds rate was 5 basis points almost every day over the 
intermeeting period, and the Secured Overnight Financ-
ing Rate averaged 4 basis points.  Total outstanding Fed-
eral Reserve repos averaged about $170 billion.  Amid 
improving market functioning, Federal Reserve pur-
chases of Treasury securities and agency MBS were re-
duced from around $10 billion and $8 billion per day, 

respectively, to $4 billion and $4.5 billion per day, re-
spectively, over the intermeeting period. 
Risk sentiment in foreign financial markets improved 
over the intermeeting period.  Further monetary policy 
and fiscal policy support in foreign countries, the easing 
of coronavirus-related restrictions, and a stronger-than-
expected U.S. May employment report outweighed con-
cerns about otherwise weak global economic data and 
the resurgence of U.S.–China tensions.  Liquidity in 
global dollar funding markets continued to improve, 
helped in part by the Federal Reserve’s liquidity pro-
grams, and prices of foreign risky assets increased.  In 
the AFEs, option-implied volatility measures declined 
and long-term sovereign bond yields rose moderately, 
while fiscal stimulus in Japan and Europe boosted prices 
in their respective equity markets.  Euro-area peripheral 
bond spreads narrowed after the European Commission 
proposed that the European Union be given the author-
ity to borrow €750 billion to assist the recovery and the 
European Central Bank (ECB) increased the size of its 
Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme.  In emerg-
ing markets, the rise in oil prices since late April and 
overall improvements in investor sentiment boosted as-
set prices, even as the coronavirus outbreak worsened in 
some countries.  Outflows from emerging market funds 
slowed and then turned into small inflows later in the 
period. 
The improving risk sentiment also supported several 
foreign currencies, and the staff’s broad dollar index fell.  
The euro appreciated notably over the period, lifted in 
part by the European fiscal and monetary policy com-
munications.  The recent rebound in oil prices contrib-
uted to a strong appreciation of the Canadian dollar, the 
Brazilian real, and the Mexican peso.   
Financing conditions for nonfinancial firms eased some-
what over the intermeeting period, though they re-
mained moderately strained for lower-rated borrowers.  
Investment-grade corporate bond issuance soared to 
record levels in April and remained robust in May, as is-
suers took advantage of more favorable market condi-
tions following Federal Reserve announcements of two 
facilities to support corporate credit markets.  Regarding 
these facilities, the Secondary Market Corporate Credit 
Facility began in mid-May to purchase exchange-traded 
funds whose investment objective is to provide broad 
exposure to the market for U.S. corporate bonds.   
Speculative-grade corporate bond issuance picked up 
considerably toward the end of April from very low lev-
els, though it slowed somewhat in May.  Commercial and 
industrial loans on banks’ books surged again in April, 

Page 8Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ 
 
largely driven by lending through the Paycheck Protec-
tion Program (PPP), especially at smaller banks.  Credit-
line drawdowns continued in April and May, though 
drawdowns by large firms slowed considerably from rec-
ord levels in March.   
The credit quality of nonfinancial corporations contin-
ued to deteriorate sharply during the intermeeting pe-
riod.  The volume of nonfinancial corporate bond and 
leveraged loan downgrades remained very high in April 
and May.  Defaults in corporate bonds and leveraged 
loans increased as well; market analysts projected de-
faults to increase considerably over the remainder of 
2020 and into 2021.   
Financing conditions for small businesses tightened 
amid widespread continued pandemic-related closures 
and reduced operations of small businesses.  Lenders in-
dicated that they had tightened loan standards on small 
business loans or discontinued lending to such borrow-
ers altogether (other than PPP loans).  Financing condi-
tions for state and local governments improved moder-
ately following several Federal Reserve announcements 
to support the municipal debt market, but conditions re-
mained somewhat strained for lower-rated states and 
municipalities.  In the first week of June, the State of Il-
linois became the first to use the Municipal Liquidity Fa-
cility.   
Commercial real estate (CRE) lending conditions recov-
ered somewhat during the intermeeting period.  Spreads 
on triple-A-rated and triple-B-rated non-agency CMBS 
declined in May but remained elevated relative to before 
the pandemic, and issuance showed signs of recovery in 
late April and early May.  Federal Reserve purchases of 
agency CMBS reportedly helped return spreads on these 
securities to their pre-pandemic levels, and issuance in 
that market continued to be strong.  However, early 
signs of credit repayment difficulties emerged in some 
CRE sectors.   
The volume of mortgage rate locks for home-purchase 
loans picked up in mid-May following a material drop in 
April.  Financing conditions remained tight for borrow-
ers with relatively low credit scores and for those seeking 
nonconforming mortgages.  In addition, options for 
home equity extraction continued to be restricted, as 
credit for both home equity lines of credit and cash-out 
refinances was limited.  Servicers were able to handle the 
liquidity strains imposed by forbearance. 
The sharp decline in economic activity had also curtailed 
the demand for consumer credit.  On balance, consumer 
credit financing conditions did not appear to be a major 

drag on household spending.  Issuance of consumer  
asset-backed securities resumed in mid-April and in early 
May but remained significantly below pre-pandemic lev-
els. 

Staff Economic Outlook 

The projection for the U.S. economy prepared by the 
staff for the June FOMC meeting was downgraded, on 
balance, as compared with the April meeting forecast in 
response to information on the spread of the corona-
virus and changes in the measures undertaken to contain 
it both at home and abroad, along with incoming eco-
nomic data.  U.S. real GDP was forecast to show a his-
torically large decline in the second quarter of this year, 
and the unemployment rate was expected to be sharply 
higher than in the first quarter.  The substantial fiscal 
policy measures and appreciable support from monetary 
policy, along with the Federal Reserve’s liquidity and 
lending facilities, were expected to help mitigate the de-
terioration in current economic conditions and to help 
boost the recovery.   
The staff continued to judge that the future performance 
of the economy would depend importantly on the evo-
lution of the coronavirus outbreak and the measures un-
dertaken to contain it.  Under the staff’s baseline as-
sumptions that the current restrictions on social interac-
tions and business operations would continue to ease 
gradually this year, real GDP was forecast to rise appre-
ciably and the unemployment rate to decline considera-
bly in the second half of the year, although a complete 
recovery was not expected by year-end.  Inflation was 
projected to weaken this year, reflecting both the deteri-
oration in resource utilization and sizable expected de-
clines in consumer energy prices.  Under the baseline as-
sumptions, economic conditions were projected to con-
tinue to improve, and inflation to pick back up, over the 
next two years. 
The staff still observed that the uncertainty related to the 
economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic was ex-
tremely elevated and that the historical behavior of the 
U.S. economy in response to past economic shocks pro-
vided limited guidance for making judgments about how 
the economy might evolve in the future.  In light of the 
significant uncertainty and downside risks associated 
with the pandemic, including how much the economy 
would weaken and how long it would take to recover, 
the staff judged that a more pessimistic projection was 
no less plausible than the baseline forecast.  In this sce-
nario, a second wave of the coronavirus outbreak, with 
another round of strict limitations on social interactions 
and business operations, was assumed to begin later this 

Minutes of the Meeting of June 9–10, 2020Page 9_____________________________________________________________________________________________ 
 
year, leading to a decrease in real GDP, a jump in the 
unemployment rate, and renewed downward pressure 
on inflation next year.  Compared with the baseline, the 
disruption to economic activity was more severe and 
protracted in this scenario, with real GDP and inflation 
lower and the unemployment rate higher by the end of 
the medium-term projection. 

Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the 
Economic Outlook 

In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, participants 
submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes 
for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and infla-
tion for each year from 2020 through 2022 and over the 
longer run, based on their individual assessments of ap-
propriate monetary policy—including the path for the 
federal funds rate.  The longer-run projections repre-
sented each participant’s assessment of the rate to which 
each variable would be expected to converge, over time, 
under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of 
further shocks to the economy.  These projections are 
described in the Summary of Economic Projections, 
which is an addendum to these minutes. 
Participants noted that the coronavirus outbreak was 
causing tremendous human and economic hardship 
across the United States and around the world.  The vi-
rus and the measures taken to protect public health in-
duced sharp declines in economic activity and a surge in 
job losses.  Weaker demand and significantly lower oil 
prices were holding down consumer price inflation.  Fi-
nancial conditions had improved, in part reflecting pol-
icy measures to support the economy and the flow of 
credit to U.S. households and businesses.   
Participants agreed that lowering the federal funds rate 
to its ELB had established more accommodative finan-
cial conditions and that the Federal Reserve’s ongoing 
purchases of sizable quantities of Treasury securities and 
agency MBS had helped restore smooth market func-
tioning to support the economy and the flow of credit 
to U.S. households and businesses.  The fiscal response 
to economic developments had been large and timely 
and was providing much needed support for economic 
activity.  Credit flows and economic activity were also 
being supported by the lending facilities established un-
der the authority of section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve 
Act with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury. 
Participants judged that the effects of the coronavirus 
outbreak and the ongoing public health crisis will weigh 
heavily on economic activity, employment, and inflation 
in the near term and would pose considerable risks to 

the economic outlook over the medium term.  Partici-
pants agreed that the data for the second quarter would 
likely show the largest decline in economic activity in 
post–World War II history.  Based in part on infor-
mation from their Districts, participants observed that 
the burdens of the present crisis were not falling equally 
on all Americans and noted that the rise in joblessness 
was especially severe for lower-wage workers, women, 
African Americans, and Hispanics.  Participants agreed 
that recently enacted fiscal policy programs had been de-
livering valuable direct financial aid to households, busi-
nesses, and communities, as well as providing relief to 
disadvantaged groups.   
Regarding household spending, participants pointed to 
information from District contacts, to surveys of con-
sumer behavior, and to high-frequency indicators—such 
as credit card transactions, automated teller machine vis-
its, and cellphone data tracking—as suggesting that con-
sumer expenditures may be stabilizing or rebounding 
modestly.  Limited available sources of standard eco-
nomic data, such as retail purchases and motor vehicle 
sales, also seemed in line with this impression.  With sup-
portive monetary policy and payments to households 
under the CARES Act (Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and 
Economic Security Act), including enhanced unemploy-
ment insurance payments, participants expected per-
sonal consumption expenditures to grow strongly in the 
second half of the year, albeit from very low levels.  
However, the recovery in consumer spending was not 
expected to be particularly rapid beyond this year, with 
voluntary social distancing, precautionary saving, and 
lower levels of employment and income restraining the 
pace of expansion over the medium term. 
Participants noted that levels of uncertainty and risks 
perceived by businesses remained high and that these 
factors continued to contribute to restraints on capital 
expenditures, despite easing in financing conditions 
stemming in part from recent policy measures.  Some 
business contacts pointed to halting improvements in 
consumer demand, a dearth in public infrastructure pro-
jects due to strained state and local government budget 
conditions, or the decline in energy prices as factors 
likely to depress business spending.  Some participants 
also noted reports of firms stating that they have had 
some challenges in rehiring employees, in part related to 
temporary enhanced unemployment insurance benefits.  
Participants generally agreed that practices and develop-
ments in public health to address the pandemic would 
be critical for ensuring a strong and lasting reopening of 
businesses and reducing the likelihood of an outsized 
wave of closures, but monetary policy and, especially, 

Page 10Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ 
 
fiscal policy would play important roles.  Nevertheless, 
participants concluded that voluntary social distancing 
and structural shifts stemming from the pandemic would 
likely mean that some proportion of businesses would 
close permanently.  Noting ongoing changes in the com-
position of production and the processes by which pro-
duction takes place, participants suggested that some 
business adaptations were likely to endure long after the 
coronavirus subsides, resulting in notable dislocation 
and sectoral reallocation of firms and workers across in-
dustries.    
Participants noted that conditions in the energy sector 
remained difficult amid still-low oil prices.  Several par-
ticipants anticipated continued low drilling activity, at 
least until excess inventories were reduced later this year, 
and expressed concern that a wave of bankruptcies in 
the energy sector could be forthcoming.  In addition, the 
agricultural sector continued to be under stress due to 
low prices for some farm commodities, reduced ethanol 
production, and pandemic-related limitations on pro-
duction for some food processing plants. 
With regard to the labor market, participants remarked 
on the surprisingly positive news from the labor market 
report for May but emphasized that nearly 20 million 
jobs had been lost, on net, since February.  Participants 
noted that because of misclassification errors in the Cur-
rent Population Survey, the official unemployment rate 
for May likely understated the extent of unemployment; 
others observed that government reliance on unemploy-
ment insurance as a vehicle for income support under 
the CARES Act complicates the interpretation of the 
data.  Participants also noted that unemployment insur-
ance claims continued to run at a historically elevated 
level, but the proportion of laid-off workers who ex-
pected to be recalled was unusually large.  Taken to-
gether, the data suggested that April could turn out to be 
the trough of the recession, but participants agreed that 
it was too early to draw any firm conclusions.  
Prospects for further substantial improvement in the la-
bor market were seen as depending on a sustained reo-
pening of the economy, which in turn depended in large 
part on the efficacy of health measures taken to limit the 
effects of the coronavirus.  On this issue, participants 
judged there to be a great deal of uncertainty and ex-
pressed concerns about the possibility that an early reo-
pening would contribute to a significant increase of in-
fections.  Participants also regarded highly accommoda-
tive monetary policy and sustained support from fiscal 
policy as likely to be needed to facilitate a durable recov-

ery in labor market conditions.  Overall, participants ex-
pected that a full recovery in employment would take 
some time. 
With regard to inflation, participants reiterated their 
view that the negative effect from the pandemic on ag-
gregate demand was likely to more than offset any up-
ward pressure from supply constraints so that the overall 
effect of the outbreak on prices was seen as disinflation-
ary.  Consistent with that interpretation, participants ob-
served the recent negative readings on the monthly CPI 
and noted that they anticipated that the 12-month PCE 
inflation measure would likely run well below the Com-
mittee’s 2 percent objective for some time.  Observing 
that inflation had been running somewhat below the 
Committee’s 2 percent longer-run objective before the 
coronavirus outbreak, some participants noted a risk 
that long-term inflation expectations might deteriorate.  
Participants noted that a highly accommodative stance 
of monetary policy would likely be needed for some time 
to achieve the 2 percent inflation objective over the 
longer run. 
Participants commented that there remained an extraor-
dinary amount of uncertainty and considerable risks to 
the economic outlook.  Participants shared views on 
possible outcomes for the reopening of the economy, 
the prospects for effective voluntary social distancing, 
and the efficacy of public health initiatives for their im-
plications for economic activity and employment.  A 
number of participants judged that there was a substan-
tial likelihood of additional waves of outbreaks, which, 
in some scenarios, could result in further economic dis-
ruptions and possibly a protracted period of reduced 
economic activity.  Other possibilities included eco-
nomic activity that might recover more quickly if sizable, 
widespread outbreaks could be avoided even as house-
holds and businesses relax or modify social-distancing 
behaviors.  Among the other sources of risk noted by 
participants were that fiscal support for households, 
businesses, and state and local governments might prove 
to be insufficient and that foreign economies could 
come under greater pressure than anticipated as a result 
of the spread of the pandemic abroad.  Participants 
stressed that measures taken in the areas of health-care 
policy and fiscal policy, together with actions by house-
holds and businesses, would shape the prospects for a 
prompt and timely return of the U.S. economy to more 
normal conditions.  In addition, participants agreed that 
recent actions taken by the Federal Reserve had helped 
reduce risks to the economic outlook. 

Minutes of the Meeting of June 9–10, 2020Page 11_____________________________________________________________________________________________ 
 
As part of their discussions of longer-run risks, partici-
pants noted that in some adverse scenarios, more busi-
ness closures would occur, and workers would experi-
ence longer spells of unemployment that could lead to a 
loss of skills that could impair their employment pro-
spects.  In addition, to the extent that transmission- 
mitigation procedures adopted by firms reduced their 
productivity, or if the reallocation of industry output re-
sulted in a lasting reduction in business investment, the 
longer-run level of potential output could be reduced. 
Regarding developments in financial markets, partici-
pants agreed that ongoing actions by the Federal Re-
serve, including those undertaken in collaboration with 
the Treasury, had helped ease strains in some financial 
markets and supported the flow of credit to households, 
businesses, and communities.  Measures of market func-
tioning in the markets for Treasury securities and agency 
MBS had improved substantially since March.  Strains in 
short-term funding markets had receded as well, and the 
volume of borrowing at many of the Federal Reserve’s 
liquidity facilities had moved lower as borrowers re-
turned to market sources of funding.  Risk spreads 
across a range of fixed-income markets had narrowed as 
the intense flight to safety witnessed in financial markets 
in the spring ebbed further.  
In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, 
participants reaffirmed that the Federal Reserve was 
committed to using its full range of tools to support the 
U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promot-
ing its maximum-employment and price-stability goals.  
In light of their assessment that the ongoing public 
health crisis would weigh heavily on economic activity, 
employment, and inflation in the near term and posed 
considerable risks to the economic outlook over the me-
dium term, all participants judged that it would be ap-
propriate to maintain the target range for the federal 
funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent.  Keeping the target range 
at the ELB would continue to provide support to the 
economy and promote the Committee’s maximum- 
employment and price-stability goals.  Participants also 
judged that it would be appropriate to maintain the tar-
get range for the federal funds rate at its present level 
until policymakers were confident that the economy had 
weathered recent events and was on track to achieve the 
Committee’s maximum-employment and price-stability 
goals. 
Participants also agreed that, to support the flow of 
credit to households and businesses, over coming 
months it would be appropriate for the Federal Reserve 
to increase its holdings of Treasury securities and agency 

MBS and agency CMBS at least at the current pace to 
sustain smooth market functioning, thereby fostering ef-
fective transmission of monetary policy to broader fi-
nancial conditions.  In addition, the Desk would con-
tinue to offer large-scale overnight and term repo oper-
ations.  Participants noted that it would be important to 
continue to monitor developments closely and that the 
Committee would be prepared to adjust its plans as ap-
propriate. 
Participants also commented that the lending facilities 
established by the Federal Reserve under the authority 
of section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act were sup-
porting financial market functioning and the flow of 
credit to households, businesses of all sizes, and state 
and local governments.  Several participants commented 
further that it would be important for the Federal Re-
serve to remain ready to adjust these emergency lending 
facilities as appropriate based on its monitoring of finan-
cial market functioning and credit conditions. 
Participants agreed that the current stance of monetary 
policy remained appropriate, but many noted that the 
Committee could, at upcoming meetings, further clarify 
its intentions with respect to its future monetary policy 
decisions as the economic outlook becomes clearer.  In 
particular, most participants commented that the Com-
mittee should communicate a more explicit form of for-
ward guidance for the path of the federal funds rate and 
provide more clarity regarding purchases of Treasury se-
curities and agency MBS as more information about the 
trajectory of the economy becomes available.  A number 
of participants judged that it was important for forward 
guidance and asset purchases to be structured in a way 
that provides the accommodation necessary to support 
rapid economic recovery and fosters a durable return of 
inflation and inflation expectations to levels consistent 
with the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective.  
Many participants remarked that the completion of the 
monetary policy framework review, together with the 
announcement of the conclusions arising from the re-
view and the release of a revised Committee statement 
on its goals and policy strategy, would help clarify further 
how the Committee intends to conduct monetary policy 
going forward.   

Committee Policy Action  

In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, 
members agreed that the coronavirus outbreak was caus-
ing tremendous human and economic hardship across 
the United States and around the world.  The virus and 
the measures taken to protect public health had induced 
sharp declines in economic activity and a surge in job 

Page 12Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ 
 
losses.  Consumer price inflation was being held down 
by weaker demand and significantly lower oil prices.  Fi-
nancial conditions had improved, in part reflecting pol-
icy measures to support the economy and the flow of 
credit to U.S. households, businesses, and communities.  
Members agreed that the Federal Reserve was commit-
ted to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. 
economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its 
maximum-employment and price-stability goals.  
Members further concurred that the ongoing public 
health crisis would weigh heavily on economic activity, 
employment, and inflation in the near term and posed 
considerable downside risks to the economic outlook 
over the medium term.  In light of these developments, 
members decided to maintain the target range for the 
federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent.  Members noted 
that they expected to maintain this target range until they 
were confident that the economy had weathered recent 
events and was on track to achieve the Committee’s 
maximum-employment and price-stability goals.  
Members agreed that they would continue to monitor 
the implications of incoming information for the eco-
nomic outlook, including information related to public 
health, as well as global developments and muted infla-
tion pressures, and would use the Committee’s tools and 
act as appropriate to support the economy.  In determin-
ing the timing and size of future adjustments to the 
stance of monetary policy, members noted that they 
would assess realized and expected economic conditions 
relative to the Committee’s maximum-employment ob-
jective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective.  
This assessment would take into account a wide range of 
information, including measures of labor market condi-
tions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation ex-
pectations, and readings on financial and international 
developments.  
To support the flow of credit to households and busi-
nesses, members agreed that over coming months it 
would be appropriate for the Federal Reserve to increase 
its holdings of Treasury securities and agency MBS and 
agency CMBS at least at the current pace to sustain 
smooth market functioning, thereby fostering effective 
transmission of monetary policy to broader financial 
conditions.  In addition, the Desk would continue to of-
fer large-scale overnight and term repo operations.  
Members agreed that they would closely monitor devel-
opments and be prepared to adjust their plans as appro-
priate. 
At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee 
voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank 

 

of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute 
transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the fol-
lowing domestic policy directive, for release at 2:00 p.m.: 
“Effective June 11, 2020, the Federal Open 
Market Committee directs the Desk to: 
 Undertake open market operations as nec-
essary to maintain the federal funds rate in 
a target range of 0 to ¼ percent. 
Increase the System Open Market Account 
holdings of Treasury securities, agency 
mortgage-backed securities (MBS), and 
agency commercial mortgage-backed secu-
rities (CMBS) at least at the current pace to 
sustain smooth functioning of markets for 
these securities, thereby fostering effective 
transmission of monetary policy to broader 
financial conditions. 
 Conduct term and overnight repurchase 
agreement operations to support effective 
policy implementation and the smooth 
functioning of short-term U.S. dollar fund-
ing markets. 
 Conduct overnight reverse repurchase 
agreement operations at an offering rate of 
0.00 percent and with a per-counterparty 
limit of $30 billion per day; the per-counter-
party limit can be temporarily increased at 
the discretion of the Chair. 
 Roll over at auction all principal payments 
from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of 
Treasury securities and reinvest all principal 
payments from the Federal Reserve’s hold-
ings of agency debt and agency MBS in 
agency MBS and all principal payments 
from holdings of agency CMBS in agency 
CMBS. 
 Allow modest deviations from stated 
amounts for purchases and reinvestments, 
if needed for operational reasons. 
 Engage in dollar roll and coupon swap 
transactions as necessary to facilitate settle-
ment of the Federal Reserve’s agency MBS 
transactions.” 
The vote also encompassed approval of the statement 
below for release at 2:00 p.m.:

Minutes of the Meeting of June 9–10, 2020Page 13_____________________________________________________________________________________________ 
 
The coronavirus outbreak is causing tremen-
dous human and economic hardship across the 
United States and around the world.  The virus 
and the measures taken to protect public health 
have induced sharp declines in economic activ-
ity and a surge in job losses.  Weaker demand 
and significantly lower oil prices are holding 
down consumer price inflation.  Financial con-
ditions have improved, in part reflecting policy 
measures to support the economy and the flow 
of credit to U.S. households and businesses. 
The ongoing public health crisis will weigh 
heavily on economic activity, employment, and 
inflation in the near term, and poses considera-
ble risks to the economic outlook over the me-
dium term.  In light of these developments, the 
Committee decided to maintain the target range 
for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent.  The 
Committee expects to maintain this target range 
until it is confident that the economy has weath-
ered recent events and is on track to achieve its 
maximum employment and price stability goals. 
The Committee will continue to monitor the 
implications of incoming information for the 
economic outlook, including information re-
lated to public health, as well as global develop-
ments and muted inflation pressures, and will 
use its tools and act as appropriate to support 
the economy.  In determining the timing and 
size of future adjustments to the stance of mon-
etary policy, the Committee will assess realized 
and expected economic conditions relative to its 
maximum employment objective and its sym-
metric 2 percent inflation objective.  This as-
sessment will take into account a wide range of 
information, including measures of labor mar-
ket conditions, indicators of inflation pressures 
and inflation expectations, and readings on fi-
nancial and international developments. 
To support the flow of credit to households and 
businesses, over  coming  months  the  Federal 

Reserve will increase its holdings of Treasury se-
curities and agency residential and commercial 
mortgage-backed securities at least at the cur-
rent pace to sustain smooth market functioning, 
thereby fostering effective transmission of 
monetary policy to broader financial conditions.  
In addition, the Open Market Desk will con-
tinue to offer large-scale overnight and term re-
purchase agreement operations.  The Commit-
tee will closely monitor developments and is 
prepared to adjust its plans as appropriate.” 
Voting for this action:  Jerome H. Powell, John C. 
Williams, Michelle W. Bowman, Lael Brainard, Richard 
H. Clarida, Patrick Harker, Robert S. Kaplan, Neel 
Kashkari, Loretta J. Mester, and Randal K. Quarles. 

Voting against this action:  None. 

Consistent with the Committee’s decision to leave the 
target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the 
Board of Governors voted unanimously to leave the in-
terest rates on required and excess reserve balances at 
0.10 percent. The Board of Governors also voted unan-
imously to approve establishment of the primary credit 
rate at the existing level of 0.25 percent, effective 
June 11, 2020. 
It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee 
would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, July 28–29, 
2020. The meeting adjourned at 10:05 a.m. on June 10, 
2020. 

Notation Vote  

By notation vote completed on May 19, 2020, the Com-
mittee unanimously approved the minutes of the Com-
mittee meeting held on April 28–29, 2020.

Summary of Economic Projections 

In conjunction with the Federal Open Market Commit-
tee (FOMC) meeting held on June 9–10, 2020, meeting 
participants submitted their projections of the most 
likely outcomes for real gross domestic product (GDP) 
growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each 
year from 2020 to 2022 and over the longer run.  Each 
participant’s projections were based on information 
available at the time of the meeting, together with his or 
her assessment of appropriate monetary policy—includ-
ing a path for the federal funds rate and its longer-run 
value—and assumptions about other factors likely to af-
fect economic outcomes.  The longer-run projections 
represent each participant’s assessment of the value to 
which each variable would be expected to converge, over 
time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the ab-
sence of further shocks to the economy.1  “Appropriate 
monetary policy” is defined as the future path of policy 
that each participant deems most likely to foster out-
comes for economic activity and inflation that best sat-
isfy his or her individual interpretation of the statutory 
mandate to promote maximum employment and price 
stability. 
The current projections for real activity, the labor mar-
ket, and inflation were substantially weaker than the pro-
jections in the December 2019 Summary of Economic 
Projections (SEP) because participants revised their eco-
nomic outlook in light of the effects of the coronavirus 
(COVID-19) pandemic and the measures taken to con-
tain it.2  Table 1 and figure 1 provide summary statistics 
for the projections; participants’ projections in the cur-
rent SEP reflected their assumptions about the course of 
the pandemic and actions to control its spread.  All par-
ticipants projected that real GDP will contract sharply in 
2020 and that the unemployment rate in the final quarter 
of the year would be markedly higher than they had pro-
jected in December.  Almost all participants projected 
that real GDP would grow faster than their estimates of 
its longer-run normal growth rate in 2021 and 2022 and 
that the unemployment rate would decline.  Participants 
expected that a full economic recovery would take some 
time, with almost all participants projecting that the un-
employment rate in the final quarter of 2022 would still 
be above their estimates of its level in the longer run. 

Similarly, almost all participants projected that total in-
flation, as measured by the four-quarter percent change 
in the price index for personal consumption expendi-
tures (PCE), would be below the FOMC’s 2 percent in-
flation objective throughout the forecast period.  Projec-
tions for core PCE inflation, which excludes food and 
energy, generally followed a trajectory similar to the pro-
jections for total inflation.   
As shown in figure 2, almost all participants indicated 
that their expectations regarding the evolution of the 
economy, relative to the Committee’s objectives of max-
imum employment and 2 percent inflation, would likely 
warrant keeping the federal funds rate at its current level 
through at least the end of 2022.  The median of partic-
ipants’ assessments of the longer-run level for the federal 
funds rate was unchanged from its value in the Decem-
ber SEP. 
Amid uncertainty about the course of the pandemic and 
its effects on the economy, all participants regarded the 
uncertainties around their projections as higher than the 
average over the past 20 years.  In addition, a substantial 
majority of participants assessed the risks to their out-
look for real GDP growth as weighted to the downside 
and the risks to their unemployment rate projections as 
weighted to the upside.  The risks to inflation projections 
were judged as weighted to the downside by a substantial 
majority of participants; no participant assessed the risks 
to his or her inflation outlook as weighted to the upside. 

The Outlook for Real GDP Growth and the Unem-
ployment Rate 

As illustrated in figure 3.A, which shows the distribu-
tions of participants’ projections for real GDP growth 
from 2020 to 2022 and in the longer run, all participants 
projected that real GDP will decline in 2020, a develop-
ment that reflects the coronavirus outbreak and the 
measures undertaken to contain its spread.  The projec-
tions ranged from a decline of 10.0 percent to a decline 
of 4.2 percent, with the median projection being a de-
crease of 6.5 percent.  These projections were substan-
tially weaker than those from the December SEP when 
real GDP was expected to expand this year at close to 
participants’ estimates of its longer-run rate.  Current ex-

1 One participant did not submit longer-run projections for 
real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, or the federal funds 
rate. 

2 The preceding SEP occurred in December 2019.  Because of 
the extraordinary circumstances surrounding the March 2020 
FOMC meeting, participants did not submit quarterly eco-
nomic projections at that meeting.

Note: Projections of change in real gross domestic product (GDP) and projections for both measures of inﬂation are percent changes from the
fourth quarter of the previous year to the fourth quarter of the year indicated. PCE inﬂation and core PCE inﬂation are the percentage rates of change
in, respectively, the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and the price index for PCE excluding food and energy. Projections for
the unemployment rate are for the average civilian unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of the year indicated. Each participant’s projections are
based on his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy. Longer-run projections represent each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each
variable would be expected to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. The projections for the
federal funds rate are the value of the midpoint of the projected appropriate target range for the federal funds rate or the projected appropriate target
level for the federal funds rate at the end of the speciﬁed calendar year or over the longer run. The December projections were made in conjunction with
the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on December 10–11, 2019. One participant did not submit longer-run projections for the change in
real GDP, the unemployment rate, or the federal funds rate in conjunction with the December 10–11, 2019, meeting, and one participant did not submit
such projections in conjunction with the June 9–10, 2020, meeting. No projections were submitted in conjunction with the March 2020 FOMC meeting.
1. For each period, the median is the middle projection when the projections are arranged from lowest to highest. When the number of projections
is even, the median is the average of the two middle projections.
2. The central tendency excludes the three highest and three lowest projections for each variable in each year.
3. The range for a variable in a given year includes all participants’ projections, from lowest to highest, for that variable in that year.
4. Longer-run projections for core PCE inﬂation are not collected.

cover during the next couple of years.  Almost all partic-
ipants expected that the rate of real GDP growth in 2021 
and 2022 would be above their estimates of its longer-
run pace, with the median projections being 5.0 percent 
and 3.5 percent, respectively.  The distribution of esti-
mates of real GDP growth in the longer run was little 
changed from the December SEP, although the median 
projection ticked down to 1.8 percent.   
The distributions of participants’ projections for the un-
employment rate from 2020 to 2022 and in the longer 
run are shown in figure 3.B.  Reflecting the effects of the 
pandemic, the projections for the unemployment rate 
were revised up considerably throughout the forecast 
period relative to the December SEP.  The projections 
for the unemployment rate in the final quarter of this 
year ranged from 7.0 to 14.0 percent, with a median of 
9.3 percent.  For the final quarter of 2021, the projec-
tions for the unemployment rate ranged from 4.5 to 
12.0 percent, with the median being 6.5 percent.  The 
width of the ranges of the forecasts for the unemploy-
ment rate in the final quarters of this year and next year 
were 7.0 percentage points and 7.5 percentage points, re-
spectively—more than three times the widest ranges for 
forecasts of similar horizons that were submitted from 
2007 to 2009.  This unusually wide range of projections 
highlighted the challenges of assessing the economic 
damage caused by the pandemic and of forecasting the 
recovery in the labor market.  The median projection for 
the unemployment rate in the final quarter of 2022, at 
5.5 percent, was above the median estimate of the 
longer-run normal rate of unemployment of 4.1 percent.  
Indeed, almost all participants who submitted longer-
run projections expected that the unemployment rate in 
the final quarter of 2022 would still be above their esti-
mates of the longer-run value.  Participants pointed to a 
number of factors to explain the persistence of labor 
market slack, including the continuation of voluntary so-
cial distancing, unusual disruptions to labor markets, and 
the need for businesses to restructure supply chains and 
other aspects of their operations.  The distribution of 
estimates for the longer-run unemployment rate was lit-
tle changed from the December SEP.  

The Outlook for Inflation 

Figures 3.C and 3.D show the distributions of partici-
pants’ projections for total and core PCE inflation from 
2020 to 2022 and in the longer run.  All participants re-
vised down their projections for inflation in 2020 relative 
to their December projections.  Participants expected 
that, in 2020, total inflation would be between 0.5 and 
1.2 percent,  while   core  inflation  would  be   between

there is about a 70 percent probability that actual outcomes for real 
GDP, unemployment, consumer prices, and the federal funds rate will 
be in ranges implied by the average size of projection errors made in the 
past.  For more information, see David Reifschneider and Peter Tulip

0.7 and 1.3 percent, with median expectations for total 
and core inflation of 0.8 percent and 1.0 percent, respec-
tively.  In the December SEP, participants had expected 
that total inflation would be between 1.7 and 2.3 percent 
in 2020.  In the current SEP, almost all participants ex-
pected the inflation rate to rise over the next two years.  
However, the vast majority of participants expected 
PCE price inflation in 2022 to fall short of the Commit-
tee’s 2 percent inflation objective, with the median pro-
jection for total PCE price inflation being 1.7 percent.   

Appropriate Monetary Policy 

The distributions of participants’ judgments regarding 
the appropriate target—or midpoint of the target 
range—for the federal funds rate at the end of each year 
from 2020 to 2022 and over the longer run are shown in 
figure 3.E.  With substantial agreement that the unem-
ployment rate would remain above its longer-run level 
throughout the forecast period and that inflation would 
run below the Committee’s objective of 2 percent, al-
most all participants projected that it would be appropri-
ate to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate 
at 0 to ¼ percent through at least the end of 2022.  The 
median of participants’ estimates of the longer-run level 
of the federal funds rate was unchanged from December 
at 2.50 percent, although a few participants revised down 
their estimates.

In assessing the appropriate path for monetary policy, 
FOMC participants take account of the range of possible 
economic outcomes, the likelihood of those outcomes, 
and the potential benefits and costs should they occur.  
Participants’ assessments of the level of uncertainty sur-
rounding their individual economic projections relative 
to the average level of uncertainty over the past 20 years 
are shown in the panels on the left side of figure 4.3  All 
participants viewed the current uncertainty surrounding 
each of the four economic variables—real GDP growth, 
the unemployment rate, total PCE inflation, and core 
PCE inflation—as being greater than the average over 
the past 20 years, which is the first time this situation has 
occurred since the introduction of the SEP in 2007.4 
Participants’ assessments of the balance of risks to their 
current economic projections are shown in the panels on 
the right side of figure 4.  A substantial majority of par-
ticipants judged the risks to their projections for real 
GDP growth as weighted to the downside and the risks 
to their unemployment rate projections as weighted to 
the upside.  A substantial majority of participants viewed 
the risks to their inflation projections as weighted to the 
downside; no participant assessed the risks to his or her 
inflation outlook as weighted to the upside. 
In discussing the uncertainty and risks surrounding their 
economic projections, the course of the pandemic was 
generally mentioned as a key source of uncertainty.  The 
possibilities of second waves of contagion and delays in

developing a vaccine were seen as potential downside 
risks to the economic outlook, and faster-than- 
anticipated progress in responding to or treating the 
coronavirus were seen as potential upside risks.  Partici-
pants also mentioned a number of other unknowns and 
risk factors related to the outlook, including the extent 
of supply-side disruptions; possible changes in house-
hold behavior; the degree to which business bankrupt-
cies might cause dislocations; the extent of fiscal policy 
support; and possibly depressed foreign demand given 
the global nature of the pandemic.  Several participants 
also expressed concerns about longer-run issues in the 
event of a prolonged recession, such as labor market 
scarring if the unemployment rate remained elevated and 
inflation persistently undershooting the FOMC’s 2 per-
cent inflation objective.   
Participants’ assessments of the appropriate future path 
of the federal funds rate are also subject to considerable 
uncertainty.  Because the Committee adjusts monetary 
policy in response to actual and prospective develop-
ments over time in key economic variables—such as real 
GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation—
uncertainty surrounding the projected path for the fed-
eral funds rate importantly reflects the uncertainties 
about the paths for these economic variables, along with 
other factors.  As with the macroeconomic variables, the 
forecast uncertainty surrounding the appropriate path of 
the federal funds rate is substantial. 

3 As a reference, table 2 provides estimates of the forecast un-
certainty for the change in real GDP, the unemployment rate, 
and total consumer price inflation over the period from 2000 
through 2019.  At the end of this summary, the box “Forecast 
Uncertainty” discusses the sources and interpretation of un-
certainty in the economic forecasts and explains the approach 
used to assess the uncertainty and risks attending participants’ 
projections.  

4 Previous SEP addendums to the FOMC minutes contained 
figures showing the median projections, along with confi-
dence intervals based on historical forecast errors.  Because 
the level of uncertainty about the economic outlook is cur-
rently judged to be higher than its historical average as a result 
of uncertainty about the course of the coronavirus and its ef-
fects on the economy, these “fan charts” have been omitted 
from this addendum.

The economic projections provided by the mem-
bers of the Board of Governors and the presidents of 
the Federal Reserve Banks inform discussions of mon-
etary policy among policymakers and can aid public un-
derstanding of the basis for policy actions.  Considera-
ble uncertainty attends these projections, however.  The 
economic and statistical models and relationships used 
to help produce economic forecasts are necessarily im-
perfect descriptions of the real world, and the future 
path of the economy can be affected by myriad unfore-
seen developments and events.  Thus, in setting the 
stance of monetary policy, participants consider not 
only what appears to be the most likely economic out-
come as embodied in their projections, but also the 
range of alternative possibilities, the likelihood of their 
occurring, and the potential costs to the economy 
should they occur. 
Table 2 summarizes the average historical accuracy 
of a range of forecasts, including those reported in past 
Monetary Policy Reports and those prepared by the Federal 
Reserve Board’s staff in advance of meetings of the Fed-
eral Open Market Committee (FOMC).  The projection 
error ranges shown in the table illustrate the considera-
ble uncertainty associated with economic forecasts.  For 
example, suppose a participant projects that real gross 
domestic product (GDP) and total consumer prices will 
rise steadily at annual rates of, respectively, 3 percent 
and 2 percent.  If the uncertainty attending those pro-
jections is similar to that experienced in the past and the 
risks around the projections are broadly balanced, the 
numbers reported in table 2 would imply a probability 
of about 70 percent that actual GDP would expand 
within a range of 1.7 to 4.3 percent in the current year, 
1.2 to 4.8 percent in the second year, and 1.0 to 5.0 per-
cent in the third year.  The corresponding 70 percent 
confidence intervals for overall inflation would be 1.3 to 
2.7 percent in the current year and 1.0 to 3.0 percent in 
the second and third years.   

Because current conditions may differ from those that 
prevailed, on average, over history, participants provide 
judgments as to whether the uncertainty attached to their 
projections of each economic variable is greater than, 
smaller than, or broadly similar to typical levels of forecast 
uncertainty seen in the past 20 years, as presented in ta-
ble 2. 
That is, participants judge whether each economic 
variable is more likely to be above or below their projec-
tions of the most likely outcome.  These judgments about 
the uncertainty and the risks attending each participant’s 
projections are distinct from the diversity of participants’ 
views about the most likely outcomes.  Forecast uncer-
tainty is concerned with the risks associated with a partic-
ular projection rather than with divergences across a num-
ber of different projections.  As with real activity and in-
flation, the outlook for the future path of the federal funds 
rate is subject to considerable uncertainty.  This uncer-
tainty arises primarily because each participant’s assess-
ment of the appropriate stance of monetary policy de-
pends importantly on the evolution of real activity and in-
flation over time.  If economic conditions evolve in an un-
expected manner, then assessments of the appropriate set-
ting of the federal funds rate would change from that point 
forward.  The final line in table 2 shows the error ranges 
for forecasts of short-term interest rates.  They suggest 
that the historical confidence intervals associated with pro-
jections of the federal funds rate are quite wide.  It should 
be noted, however, that these confidence intervals are not 
strictly consistent with the projections for the federal funds 
rate, as these projections are not forecasts of the most 
likely quarterly outcomes but rather are projections of par-
ticipants’ individual assessments of appropriate monetary 
policy and are on an end-of-year basis.  However, the fore-
cast errors should provide a sense of the uncertainty 
around the future path of the federal funds rate generated 
by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as 
well as additional adjustments to monetary policy that 
would be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the 
economy.
