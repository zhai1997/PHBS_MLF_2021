1 Attended the joint session of the Federal Open Market 
Committee and the Board of Governors. 

In the agenda for this meeting, it was reported that 
Loretta J. Mester had been elected a member of the 
Federal Open Market Committee and that she had 
executed her oath of office. 

Developments in Financial Markets and the Fed-
eral Reserve’s Balance Sheet 
In a joint session of the Federal Open Market Commit-
tee (FOMC) and the Board of Governors of the Feder-
al Reserve System, the deputy manager of the System 
Open Market Account (SOMA) reported on develop-
ments in domestic and foreign financial markets.  The 
SOMA manager reported on the System open market 
operations during the period since the Committee met 
on April 29–30, 2014, outlined the testing of the Term 
Deposit Facility, described the results from the fixed-
rate overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) 
operational exercise, and provided some possible op-
tions for adjusting the list of counterparties eligible to 
participate in ON RRP operations.  The manager also 
noted the effects of recent foreign central bank policy 
actions on the yields on the international portion of the 
SOMA portfolio and discussed ongoing staff work on 
improving data collections regarding bank funding 
markets.  By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified 
the Open Market Desk’s domestic transactions over 
the intermeeting period.  There were no intervention 
operations in foreign currencies for the System’s ac-
count over the intermeeting period. 

Monetary Policy Normalization 
Meeting participants continued their discussion of is-
sues associated with the eventual normalization of the 
stance and conduct of monetary policy.  The Commit-
tee’s consideration of this topic was undertaken as part 
of prudent planning and did not imply that normaliza-
tion would necessarily begin sometime soon.  A staff 
presentation included some possible strategies for im-
plementing and communicating monetary policy during 
a period when the Federal Reserve will have a very 
large balance sheet.  In addition, the presentation out-
lined design features of a potential ON RRP facility 
and discussed options for the Committee’s policy of 
rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction and 
reinvesting principal payments on all agency debt and 
agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) in agency 
MBS. 

Most participants agreed that adjustments in the rate of 
interest on excess reserves (IOER) should play a cen-
tral role during the normalization process.  It was gen-
erally agreed that an ON RRP facility with an interest 
rate set below the IOER rate could play a useful sup-

Page 2Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
porting role by helping to firm the floor under money 
market interest rates.  One participant thought that the 
ON RRP rate would be the more effective policy tool 
during normalization in light of the wider variety of 
counterparties eligible to participate in ON RRP opera-
tions.  The appropriate size of the spread between the 
IOER and ON RRP rates was discussed, with many 
participants judging that a relatively wide spread—
perhaps near or above the current level of 20 basis 
points—would support trading in the federal funds 
market and provide adequate control over market in-
terest rates.  Several participants noted that the spread 
might be adjusted during the normalization process.  A 
couple of participants suggested that adequate control 
of short-term rates might be accomplished with a very 
wide spread or even without an ON RRP facility.  A 
few participants commented that the Committee 
should also be prepared to use its other policy tools, 
including term deposits and term reverse repurchase 
agreements, if necessary.  Most participants thought 
that the federal funds rate should continue to play a 
role in the Committee’s operating framework and 
communications during normalization, with many of 
them indicating a preference for continuing to an-
nounce a target range.  However, a few participants 
thought that, given the degree of uncertainty about the 
effects of the Committee’s tools on market rates, it 
might be preferable to focus on an administered rate in 
communicating the stance of policy during the normal-
ization period.  In addition, participants examined pos-
sibilities for changing the calculation of the effective 
federal funds rate in order to obtain a more robust 
measure of overnight bank funding rates and to apply 
lessons from international efforts to develop improved 
standards for benchmark interest rates. 

While generally agreeing that an ON RRP facility could 
play an important role in the policy normalization pro-
cess, participants discussed several potential unintended 
consequences of using such a facility and design fea-
tures that could help to mitigate these consequences. 
Most participants expressed concerns that in times of 
financial stress, the facility’s counterparties could shift 
investments toward the facility and away from financial 
and nonfinancial corporations, possibly causing disrup-
tions in funding that could magnify the stress.  In addi-
tion, a number of participants noted that a relatively 
large ON RRP facility had the potential to expand the 
Federal Reserve’s role in financial intermediation and 
reshape the financial industry in ways that were difficult 
to anticipate.  Participants discussed design features 
that could address these concerns, including constraints 

on usage either in the aggregate or by counterparty and 
a relatively wide spread between the ON RRP rate and 
the IOER rate that would help limit the facility’s size.  
Several participants emphasized that, although the ON 
RRP rate would be useful in controlling short-term 
interest rates during normalization, they did not antici-
pate that such a facility would be a permanent part of 
the Committee’s longer-run operating framework.  Fi-
nally, a number of participants expressed concern 
about conducting monetary policy operations with 
nontraditional counterparties. 

Participants also discussed the appropriate time for 
making a change to the Committee’s policy of rolling 
over maturing Treasury securities at auction and rein-
vesting principal payments on all agency debt and 
agency MBS in agency MBS.  It was noted that, in the 
staff’s models, making a change to the Committee’s 
reinvestment policy prior to the liftoff of the federal 
funds rate, at the time of liftoff, or sometime thereafter 
would be expected to have only limited implications for 
macroeconomic outcomes, the Committee’s statutory 
objectives, or remittances to the Treasury.  Many par-
ticipants agreed that ending reinvestments at or after 
the time of liftoff would be best, with most of these 
participants preferring to end them after liftoff.  These 
participants thought that an earlier change to the rein-
vestment policy would involve risks to the economic 
outlook if it was seen as suggesting that the Committee 
was likely to tighten policy more rapidly than currently 
anticipated or if it had unexpectedly large effects in 
MBS markets; moreover, an early change could add 
complexity to the Committee’s communications at a 
time when it would be clearer to signal changes in poli-
cy through interest rates alone.  However, some partic-
ipants favored ending reinvestments prior to the first 
firming in policy interest rates, as stated in the Commit-
tee’s exit strategy principles announced in June 2011.  
Those participants thought that such an approach 
would avoid weakening the credibility of the Commit-
tee’s communications regarding normalization, would 
act to modestly reduce the size of the Federal Reserve’s 
balance sheet, or would help prepare the public for the 
eventual rise in short-term interest rates.  Regardless of 
whether they preferred to introduce a change to the 
Committee’s reinvestment policy before or after the 
initial tightening in short-term interest rates, a number 
of participants thought that it might be best to follow a 
graduated approach with respect to winding down re-
investments or to manage reinvestments in a manner 
that would smooth the decline in the balance sheet.  

Minutes of the Meeting of June 17–18, 2014Page 3_____________________________________________________________________________________________ 
 
 
 
Some stressed that the details should depend on finan-
cial and economic conditions. 

Overall, participants generally expressed a preference 
for a simple and clear approach to normalization that 
would facilitate communication to the public and en-
hance the credibility of monetary policy.  It was ob-
served that it would be useful for the Committee to 
develop and communicate its plans to the public later 
this year, well before the first steps in normalizing poli-
cy become appropriate.  Most participants indicated 
that they expected to learn more about the effects of 
the Committee’s various policy tools as normalization 
proceeds, and many favored maintaining flexibility 
about the evolution of the normalization process as 
well as the Committee’s longer-run operating frame-
work.  Participants requested additional analysis from 
the staff on issues related to normalization and agreed 
that it would be helpful to continue to review these 
issues at upcoming meetings.  The Board meeting con-
cluded at the end of the discussion. 

Staff Review of the Economic Situation 
The information reviewed for the June 17–18 meeting 
indicated that real gross domestic product (GDP) had 
dropped significantly early in the year but that econom-
ic growth had bounced back in recent months.  The 
average pace of employment gains stepped up, and the 
unemployment rate declined markedly in April and held 
steady in May, although it was still elevated.  Consumer 
price inflation picked up in recent months, while 
measures of longer-run inflation expectations remained 
stable. 

Most measures of labor market conditions improved in 
recent months.  Total nonfarm payroll employment 
expanded in April and May at a faster rate than the av-
erage monthly pace during the previous two quarters.  
The unemployment rate dropped to 6.3 percent in 
April and remained at that level in May.  However, the 
labor force participation rate also declined in April and 
then held steady in May, while the employment-to-
population ratio remained flat.  Both the share of 
workers employed part time for economic reasons and 
the rate of long-duration unemployment edged down in 
recent months, although both measures were still high.  
Initial claims for unemployment insurance decreased 
slightly, on net, over the intermeeting period, and the 
rate of job openings stepped up in April; nevertheless, 
the rate of hiring was unchanged and remained at a 
modest level. 

Industrial production increased, on balance, in April 
and May, as manufacturing output and production in 

the mining sector expanded and more than offset a 
further decline in the output of utilities from the ele-
vated levels recorded during the unusually cold winter 
months.  As a result, the rate of industrial capacity utili-
zation rose in recent months.  Automakers’ schedules 
indicated that the pace of light motor vehicle assem-
blies would step up in the coming months, and broader 
indicators of manufacturing production, such as the 
readings on new orders from national manufacturing 
surveys, were consistent with moderate increases in 
factory output in the near term. 

Real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) de-
clined a little in April following strong gains in Febru-
ary and March.  The component of the nominal retail 
sales data used by the Bureau of Economic Analysis to 
construct its estimate of PCE edged down in May, but 
light motor vehicle sales moved up briskly.  Recent in-
formation about key factors that influence household 
spending mostly pointed to gains in PCE in the coming 
months.  Real disposable income continued to rise in 
April, and households’ net worth likely increased as 
equity prices and home values advanced further; how-
ever, consumer sentiment in the Thomson Reu-
ters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers 
moved down somewhat in May and early June. 

The pace of activity in the housing sector remained 
subdued.  Starts of new single-family homes declined 
slightly, on net, in April and May, although starts of 
multifamily units increased. Permits for single-family 
homes, which are usually a better indicator of the un-
derlying pace of residential construction, increased only 
a little on balance.  Sales of new homes rose in April 
but remained near their average monthly level last year.  
Existing home sales only edged up in April and were 
still below last year’s average level, while pending home 
sales were little changed. 

Real private expenditures for business equipment and 
intellectual property products were estimated to have 
increased slowly in the first quarter as a whole.  In 
April, nominal orders and shipments of nondefense 
capital goods excluding aircraft decreased a little after 
rising briskly in March.  However, the level of new or-
ders for these capital goods remained above the level of 
shipments in April, pointing to increases in shipments 
in subsequent months.  Other forward-looking indica-
tors, such as surveys of business conditions, were also 
generally consistent with modest increases in business 
equipment spending in the near term.  Nominal busi-
ness spending for nonresidential structures was essen-
tially unchanged in April.  Recent data on the book 

Page 4Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ 
 
 
 
value of inventories, along with readings on inventories 
from national and regional manufacturing surveys, did 
not point to significant inventory imbalances in most 
industries except in the energy sector, where invento-
ries appeared unusually low after having been drawn 
down during the winter. 

Federal spending data for April and May pointed to-
ward only a small decline in real federal government 
purchases in the second quarter, as the pace of decreas-
es in defense expenditures seemed to ease.  Real state 
and local government purchases appeared to edge up 
going into the second quarter.  The payrolls of these 
governments expanded in April and May, and nominal 
state and local construction expenditures increased a 
little in April. 

The U.S. international trade deficit widened in March 
and in April.  Both imports and exports recovered from 
weak readings in February, with imports of consumer 
goods, automotive products, and capital goods rising 
significantly and exports of capital goods and industrial 
supplies showing particular strength. 

U.S. consumer price inflation, as measured by the PCE 
price index, was about 1½ percent over the 12 months 
ending in April, below the Committee’s longer-run ob-
jective of 2 percent.  Over the same 12-month period, 
consumer energy prices rose faster than total consumer 
prices, while consumer food prices climbed more slow-
ly than overall prices; core PCE inflation—which ex-
cludes food and energy prices—was also around       
1½ percent.  In May, the consumer price index (CPI) 
increased at a faster pace than in the preceding few 
months; both food and energy prices rose more briskly, 
and core CPI inflation also stepped up.  Over the 
12 months ending in May, both total and core CPI in-
flation were about 2 percent.  Near-term inflation ex-
pectations from the Michigan survey declined slightly, 
on balance, in May and early June, while longer-term 
inflation expectations from the survey were little 
changed. 

Increases in measures of labor compensation remained 
modest.  Compensation per hour in the nonfarm busi-
ness sector rose about 2¼ percent over the year ending 
in the first quarter; with small gains in labor productivi-
ty, unit labor costs advanced more slowly than com-
pensation per hour.  Over the year ending in May, av-
erage hourly earnings for all employees increased 
around 2 percent. 

Foreign real GDP growth slowed in the first quarter, 
especially in China and some other emerging market 

economies.  Real GDP also increased more slowly in 
Canada, in part because of severe winter weather, and 
the pace of economic activity remained weak in the 
euro area.  Economic growth continued to be strong in 
the United Kingdom, and economic activity jumped in 
Japan as household spending surged in advance of 
April’s consumption tax hike.  Indicators for the sec-
ond quarter generally suggested that foreign economic 
growth picked up from the first quarter.  In some ad-
vanced foreign economies, inflation moved up recently 
from earlier low readings.  Inflation continued to be 
low, however, in the euro area, and the European Cen-
tral Bank 
(ECB) announced additional stimulus 
measures. 

Staff Review of the Financial Situation 
On balance, financial conditions in the United States 
remained supportive of growth in economic activity 
and employment:  The expected path of the federal 
funds rate was slightly lower in the long run, yields on 
longer-term Treasury securities moved down modestly, 
equity prices rose, corporate bond spreads narrowed, 
and the foreign exchange value of the dollar was little 
changed. 

Federal Reserve communications over the intermeeting 
period had limited effects in financial markets.  The 
April FOMC statement and minutes appeared to be 
generally in line with expectations, while the Chair’s 
congressional testimony before the Joint Economic 
Committee in early May and the subsequent question-
and-answer session were viewed by market participants 
as suggesting marginally more accommodative policy 
than expected. 

Results from the Desk’s June Survey of Primary Deal-
ers indicated no change in the dealers’ consensus ex-
pectation about the most likely timing of the first in-
crease in the federal funds rate target but showed a 
lower median longer-run level of the federal funds rate 
relative to the April survey.  Expectations for Federal 
Reserve asset purchases were largely unchanged.  In 
addition, although there was significant dispersion 
among dealer responses, the median dealer expected 
the FOMC to end its reinvestment of principal pay-
ments on Treasury securities, agency debt, and agency 
MBS sometime after the first increase in the federal 
funds rate target; in the April survey, the median dealer 
had expected reinvestments to end before liftoff. 

Yields on short- and medium-term nominal Treasury 
securities increased slightly, on balance, over the inter-
meeting period.  In contrast, yields at the long end of 
the curve edged lower, continuing a downward trend

evident over much of this year.  Market participants 
continued to discuss the decreases in long forward rates 
since the beginning of the year and pointed to a variety 
of domestic and global factors possibly contributing to 
this trend, including lower expectations for potential 
growth and policy rates in the longer run, a decline in 
inflation risk premiums, purchases of longer-term secu-
rities by price-insensitive investors, unwinding of short 
Treasury positions, and falling interest rate uncertainty.  
Measures of longer-horizon inflation compensation 
based on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities re-
mained about steady. 

Conditions in unsecured short-term dollar funding 
markets remained stable over the intermeeting period.  
The Federal Reserve continued its ON RRP exercise.  
Total take-up in the ON RRP exercise rose in April and 
May before falling back in June.  Much of the transitory 
increase in take-up occurred in response to a large sea-
sonal reduction in outstanding Treasury debt and an 
associated drop in the rates on Treasury repurchase 
agreements during the first half of the second quarter 
that were reversed during the second half.  In May, the 
Federal Reserve began an eight-week series of test auc-
tions of seven-day term deposits.  The number of par-
ticipants and the total amount awarded increased over 
the course of the first five operations. 

Broad stock price indexes rose over the intermeeting 
period, apparently boosted by a more optimistic as-
sessment of near-term economic prospects and likely 
supported by continued low interest rates.  Despite 
generally lackluster results for first-quarter earnings, 
corporate guidance for profits in coming quarters led to 
upward revisions in analysts’ forecasts of year-ahead 
earnings per share for S&P 500 firms.  The VIX, an 
index of option-implied volatility for one-month re-
turns on the S&P 500 index, continued to decline and 
ended the period near its historical lows.  Measures of 
uncertainty in other financial markets also declined; 
results from the Desk’s primary dealer survey suggested 
this development might have reflected low realized vol-
atilities, generally favorable economic news, less uncer-
tainty for the path of monetary policy, and complacen-
cy on the part of market participants about potential 
risks. 

Credit flows to nonfinancial corporations remained 
strong.  Amid low yields and reduced market volatility, 
gross issuance of investment- and speculative-grade 
bonds rebounded in May.  Commercial and industrial 
(C&I) loans on banks’ balance sheets increased and 
issuance of leveraged loans remained strong.  Respons-

es to the June Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey on 
Dealer Financing Terms indicated that investor de-
mand for financing to fund purchases of collateralized 
loan obligations rose somewhat since the beginning of 
the year. 

Commercial real estate loans continued to increase 
amid some further easing of underwriting standards for 
commercial mortgages.  While issuance of commercial 
mortgage-backed securities started the year a bit slow 
relative to 2013, it has picked up recently.  Bank and 
insurance company originations of commercial mort-
gages expanded in the first quarter. 

Mortgage credit conditions generally remained tight, 
though further incremental signs of easing emerged 
amid continued gains in house prices.  Mortgage inter-
est rates declined somewhat more than long-term 
Treasury yields over the intermeeting period, while  
option-adjusted spreads on production-coupon MBS 
narrowed.  Both mortgage applications for home pur-
chases and refinancing applications remained at very 
low levels. 

Conditions in consumer credit markets were solid in 
recent months.  Credit card loan balances increased.  
Growth in student loans moderated further but re-
mained solid, and outstanding auto loans continued to 
pick up.  Issuance of auto and credit card asset-backed 
securities was again robust. 

The expected path of ECB policy rates implied by mar-
ket quotes for short-term interest rates fell over the 
intermeeting period, as investors anticipated the easing 
of policy announced by the ECB at its June meeting.  
By contrast, late in the period, market participants in-
terpreted statements by Bank of England Governor 
Carney as signaling an earlier tightening of policy than 
had been anticipated, and near-term policy rate expec-
tations moved higher in response.  Benchmark sover-
eign bond yields declined modestly in most countries, 
but U.K. gilt yields rose.  The foreign exchange value 
of the dollar was little changed, on balance, over the 
period, as the dollar appreciated against the euro but 
declined against the Canadian dollar and many emerg-
ing market currencies.  Consistent with some im-
provement in investor sentiment toward risky assets, 
foreign equity prices generally rose over the intermeet-
ing period, and foreign sovereign and corporate bond 
spreads narrowed.  In addition, both bond and equity 
emerging market mutual funds saw net inflows over the 
period.

Staff Economic Outlook 
In the economic forecast prepared by the staff for the 
June FOMC meeting, real GDP growth in the first half 
of this year as a whole was lower, on net, than in the 
projection for the April meeting.  In particular, the 
available readings on exports, inventory investment, 
outlays for health-care services, and construction 
pointed to much weaker real GDP in the first quarter 
than the staff had expected.  However, the staff still 
anticipated that real GDP growth would rebound brisk-
ly in the second quarter, consistent with recent indica-
tors for consumer spending and business investment, 
along with the expectation that exports and inventory 
investment would return to more normal levels and 
that economic activity that had been restrained by the 
severe winter weather would bounce back.  Primarily 
because of the combination of recent downward sur-
prises in the unemployment rate and weaker-than-
expected real GDP, the staff slightly lowered its as-
sumed pace of potential output growth this year and 
next and slightly decreased its assumption for the natu-
ral rate of unemployment over this same period.  As a 
result, the staff’s medium-term forecast for real GDP 
growth was revised down a little on balance.  Neverthe-
less, the staff continued to project that real GDP would 
expand at a faster pace in the second half of this year 
and over the next two years than it did last year and 
that it would rise more quickly than potential output.  
The faster pace of real GDP growth was expected to 
be supported by diminishing drag on spending from 
changes in fiscal policy, increases in consumer and 
business confidence, further improvements in credit 
availability, and a pickup in the rate of foreign econom-
ic growth.  The expansion in economic activity was 
anticipated to slowly reduce resource slack over the 
projection period, and the unemployment rate was ex-
pected to decline gradually to the staff’s estimate of its 
longer-run natural rate in the medium term.  In the 
longer-run outlook, the staff slightly lowered its as-
sumptions for real GDP growth and the level of equi-
librium real interest rates. 

The staff’s forecast for inflation in the near term was 
revised up a little as recent data showed somewhat fast-
er increases in consumer prices than anticipated.  How-
ever, the medium-term projection for inflation was re-
vised down slightly, reflecting a reassessment by the 
staff of the underlying trend in inflation.  The staff con-
tinued to forecast that inflation would remain below 
the Committee’s longer-run objective of 2 percent over 
the next few years.  With longer-run inflation expecta-
tions assumed to remain stable, changes in commodity 

and import prices expected to be subdued, and slack in 
labor and product markets anticipated to diminish 
slowly, inflation was projected to rise gradually toward 
the Committee’s objective.  The staff continued to pro-
ject that inflation would reach the Committee’s objec-
tive in the longer run. 

The staff’s economic projections for the June meeting 
were somewhat different from the forecasts presented 
at the March meeting, when the FOMC last prepared a 
Summary of Economic Projections (SEP).  The staff’s 
June projections for the unemployment rate, real GDP 
growth, and inflation over the next few years were all a 
little lower, on balance, than those in its March fore-
cast. 

The staff viewed the extent of uncertainty around its 
June projections for real GDP growth and the unem-
ployment rate as roughly in line with the average over 
the past 20 years.  Nonetheless, the risks to the forecast 
for real GDP growth were viewed as tilted a little to the 
downside, as neither monetary policy nor fiscal policy 
was seen as being well positioned to help the economy 
withstand adverse shocks.  At the same time, the staff 
viewed the risks around its outlook for the unemploy-
ment rate and for inflation as roughly balanced. 

Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the 
Economic Outlook 
In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, the meeting 
participants submitted their assessments of real output 
growth, the unemployment rate, inflation, and the tar-
get federal funds rate for each year from 2014 through 
2016 and over the longer run, under each participant’s 
judgment of appropriate monetary policy.3  The longer-
run projections represent each participant’s assessment 
of the rate to which each variable would be expected to 
converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy 
and in the absence of further shocks to the economy.  
These economic projections and policy assessments are 
described in the SEP, which is attached as an adden-
dum to these minutes. 

In their discussion of the economic situation and the 
outlook, meeting participants viewed the information 
received over the intermeeting period as suggesting that 
economic activity was rebounding in the second quar-

dents of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks submitted projections.  
Governor Brainard took office on June 16, 2014, and partic-
ipated in the June 17–18, 2014, meeting; she was not able to 
submit economic projections.

ter following a surprisingly large decline in real GDP in 
the first quarter of the year.  Labor market conditions 
generally improved further.  Although participants 
marked down their expectations for average growth of 
real GDP over the first half of 2014, their projections 
beginning in the second half of 2014 changed little.  
Over the next two and a half years, they continued to 
expect economic activity to expand at a rate sufficient 
to lead to a further decline in the unemployment rate to 
levels close to their current assessments of its longer-
run normal value.  Among the factors anticipated to 
support the sustained economic expansion were ac-
commodative monetary policy, diminished drag from 
fiscal restraint, further gains in household net worth, 
improving credit conditions for households and busi-
nesses, and rising employment and wages.  While infla-
tion was still seen as running below the Committee’s 
longer-run objective, longer-run inflation expectations 
remained stable and the Committee anticipated that 
inflation would move back toward its 2 percent objec-
tive over the forecast period.  Most participants viewed 
the risks to the outlook for the economy, the labor 
market, and inflation as broadly balanced. 

Household spending appeared to have risen moderate-
ly, on balance, in recent months, with sales of motor 
vehicles, in particular, rising strongly.  However, several 
participants read the recent soft information on retail 
sales and health-care spending as raising some concern 
about the underlying strength in consumer spending.  
A couple of participants noted that, to date, consumer 
spending had been supported importantly by gains in 
household net worth while income gains had been held 
back by only modest increases in wages.  In their view, 
an important element in the economic outlook was a 
pickup in income, from higher wages as well as ongo-
ing employment gains, that would be expected to sup-
port a sustained rise in consumer spending. 

The recovery in the housing sector was reported to 
have remained slow in all but a few areas of the coun-
try.  Many participants expressed concern about the 
still-soft indicators of residential construction, and they 
discussed a range of factors that might be contributing 
to either a temporary delay in the housing recovery or a 
persistently lower level of homebuilding than previous-
ly anticipated.  Despite attractive mortgage rates, hous-
ing demand was seen as being damped by such factors 
as restrictive credit conditions, particularly for house-
holds with low credit scores; high down payments; or 
low demand among younger homebuyers, due in part 
to the burden of student loan debt.  Others noted sup-
ply constraints, pointing to shortages of lots, low inven-

tories of desirable homes for sale, an overhang of 
homes associated with foreclosures or seriously delin-
quent mortgages, or rising construction costs.  Several 
other participants suggested the possibility that more 
persistent structural changes in housing demand associ-
ated with an aging population and evolving lifestyle 
preferences were boosting demand for multifamily 
units at the expense of single-family homes. 

Information from participants’ business contacts sug-
gested capital spending was likely to increase going 
forward.  Contacts in a number of Districts reported 
that they were generally optimistic about the business 
outlook, although in a couple of regions respondents 
remained cautious about prospects for stronger eco-
nomic growth or worried about a renewal of federal 
fiscal restraint after the current congressional budget 
agreement expires.  Among the industries cited as rel a-
tively strong in recent months were transportation, en-
ergy, telecommunications, and manufacturing, particu-
larly motor vehicles.  Some participants commented 
that their contacts in small and medium-sized business-
es reported an improved outlook for sales, and several 
heard businesses more generally discuss plans to in-
crease capital expenditures.  One participant noted that 
District businesses were investing largely to meet re-
placement needs, while another suggested that the 
backlog of such needs would likely provide some impe-
tus to business investment. 

Favorable financial conditions appeared be supporting 
economic activity.  While information about mortgage 
lending was mixed, a number of participants reported 
increases in C&I lending by banks in their Districts, a 
pickup in loan demand at banks, or better credit quality 
for borrowers.  In addition, small businesses reported 
improvements in credit availability.  However, partici-
pants also discussed whether some recent trends in 
financial markets might suggest that investors were not 
appropriately taking account of risks in their invest-
ment decisions.  In particular, low implied volatility in 
equity, currency, and fixed-income markets as well as 
signs of increased risk-taking were viewed by some par-
ticipants as an indication that market participants were 
not factoring in sufficient uncertainty about the path of 
the economy and monetary policy.  They agreed that 
the Committee should continue to carefully monitor 
financial conditions and to emphasize in its communi-
cations the dependence of its policy decisions on the 
evolution of the economic outlook; it was also pointed 
out that, where appropriate, supervisory measures 
should be applied to address excessive risk-taking and 
associated financial imbalances.  At the same time, it 

Page 8Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ 
 
 
 
was noted that monetary policy needed to continue to 
promote the favorable financial conditions required to 
support the economic expansion. 

In discussing economic developments abroad, a couple 
of participants noted that recent monetary policy ac-
tions by the ECB and the Bank of Japan had improved 
the outlook for economic activity in those areas and 
could help return inflation to target.  Several others, 
however, remained concerned that persistent low infla-
tion in Europe and Japan could eventually erode infla-
tion expectations more broadly.  And a couple of par-
ticipants expressed uncertainty about the outlook for 
economic growth in Japan and China.  In addition, sev-
eral saw developments in Iraq and Ukraine as posing 
possible downside risks to global economic activity or 
potential upside risks to world oil prices. 

Labor market conditions generally continued to im-
prove over the intermeeting period.  That improvement 
was evidenced by the decline in the unemployment rate 
as well as by changes in other indicators, such as solid 
gains in nonfarm payrolls, a low level of new claims for 
unemployment insurance, uptrends in quits and job 
openings, and more positive views of job availability by 
households.  In assessing labor market conditions, par-
ticipants again offered a range of views on how far 
conditions in the labor market were from those associ-
ated with maximum employment.  Many judged that 
slack remained elevated, and a number of them thought 
it was greater than measured by the official unemploy-
ment rate, citing, in particular, the still-high level of 
workers employed part time for economic reasons or 
the depressed labor force participation rate.  Even so, 
several participants pointed out that both long- and 
short-term unemployment and measures that include 
marginally attached workers had declined.  Most partic-
ipants projected the improvement in labor market con-
ditions to continue, with the unemployment rate mov-
ing down gradually over the medium term.  However, a 
couple of participants anticipated that the decline in 
unemployment would be damped as part-time workers 
shift to full-time jobs and as nonparticipants rejoin the 
labor force, while a few others commented that they 
expected no lasting reversal of the decline in labor 
force participation. 

Aggregate wage measures continued to rise at only a 
modest rate, and reports on wages from business con-
tacts and surveys in a number of Districts were mixed.  
Several of those reports pointed to an absence of wage 
pressures, while some others indicated that tight labor 
markets or shortages of skilled workers were leading to 

upward pressure on wages in some areas or occupa-
tions and that an increasing proportion of small busi-
nesses were planning to raise wages.  Participants dis-
cussed the prospects for wage increases to pick up as 
slack in the labor market diminishes.  Several noted that 
a return to growth in real wages in line with productivi-
ty growth would provide welcome support for house-
hold spending. 

Readings on a range of price measures—including the 
PCE price index, the CPI, and a number of the analyti-
cal measures developed at the Reserve Banks—
appeared to provide evidence that inflation had moved 
up recently from low levels earlier in the year, con-
sistent with the Committee’s forecast of a gradual in-
crease in inflation over the medium term.  Reports 
from business contacts were mixed, spanning an ab-
sence of price pressures in some Districts and rising 
input costs in others.  Some participants expressed 
concern about the persistence of below-trend inflation, 
and a couple of them suggested that the Committee 
may need to allow the unemployment rate to move 
below its longer-run normal level for a time in order 
keep inflation expectations anchored and return infla-
tion to its 2 percent target, though one participant em-
phasized the risks of doing so.  In contrast, some oth-
ers expected a faster pickup in inflation or saw upside 
risks to inflation and inflation expectations because 
they anticipated a more rapid decline in economic slack. 

During their consideration of issues related to mone-
tary policy over the medium term, participants generally 
supported the Committee’s current guidance about the 
likely path of its asset purchases and about its approach 
to determining the timing of the first increase in the 
federal funds rate and the path of the policy rate there-
after.  Participants offered views on a range of issues 
related to policy communications.  Some participants 
suggested that the Committee’s communications about 
its forward guidance should emphasize more strongly 
that its policy decisions would depend on its ongoing 
assessment across a range of indicators of economic 
activity, labor market conditions, inflation and inflation 
expectations, and financial market developments.  In 
that regard, circumstances that might entail either a 
slower or a more rapid removal of policy accommoda-
tion were cited.  For example, a number of participants 
noted their concern that a more gradual approach 
might be appropriate if forecasts of above-trend eco-
nomic growth later this year were not realized.  And a 
couple suggested that the Committee might need to 
strengthen its commitment to maintain sufficient policy 
accommodation to return inflation to its target over the 

Minutes of the Meeting of June 17–18, 2014Page 9_____________________________________________________________________________________________ 
 
 
 
medium term in order to prevent an undesirable de-
cline in inflation expectations.  Alternatively, some oth-
er participants expressed concern that economic 
growth over the medium run might be faster than cur-
rently expected or that the rate of growth of potential 
output might be lower than currently expected, calling 
for a more rapid move to begin raising the federal 
funds rate in order to avoid significantly overshooting 
the Committee’s unemployment and inflation objec-
tives. 

While the current asset purchase program is not on a 
preset course, participants generally agreed that if the 
economy evolved as they anticipated, the program 
would likely be completed later this year.  Some com-
mittee members had been asked by members of the 
public whether, if tapering in the pace of purchases 
continues as expected, the final reduction would come 
in a single $15 billion per month reduction or in a    
$10 billion reduction followed by a $5 billion reduction.  
Most participants viewed this as a technical issue with 
no substantive macroeconomic consequences and no 
consequences for the eventual decision about the tim-
ing of the first increase in the federal funds rate—a 
decision that will depend on the Committee’s evolving 
assessments of actual and expected progress toward its 
objectives.  In light of these considerations, participants 
generally agreed that if incoming information continued 
to support its expectation of improvement in labor 
market conditions and a return of inflation toward its 
longer-run objective, it would be appropriate to com-
plete asset purchases with a $15 billion reduction in the 
pace of purchases in order to avoid having the small, 
remaining level of purchases receive undue focus 
among investors.  If the economy progresses about as 
the Committee expects, warranting reductions in the 
pace of purchases at each upcoming meeting, this final 
reduction would occur following the October meeting. 

Committee Policy Action 
In their discussion of monetary policy in the period 
ahead, members judged that information received since 
the Federal Open Market Committee met in April indi-
cated that economic activity was rebounding from the 
decline in the first quarter of the year.  Labor market 
indicators generally showed further improvement.  The 
unemployment rate, though lower, remained elevated.  
Household spending appeared to be rising moderately 
and business fixed investment resumed its advance, 
while the recovery in the housing sector remained slow.  
Fiscal policy was restraining economic growth, alt-
hough the extent of restraint was diminishing.  The 
Committee expected that, with appropriate policy ac-

commodation, economic activity would expand at a 
moderate pace and labor market conditions would con-
tinue to improve gradually, moving toward those the 
Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate.  
Members saw the risks to the outlook for the economy 
and the labor market as nearly balanced.  Inflation was 
running below the Committee’s longer-run objective, 
but the Committee anticipated that with stable inflation 
expectations and strengthening economic activity, infla-
tion would, over time, return to the Committee’s 2 per-
cent objective.  However, members continued to rec-
ognize that inflation persistently below its longer-run 
objective could pose risks to economic performance 
and agreed to monitor inflation developments closely 
for evidence that inflation was moving back toward its 
objective over the medium term. 

Members judged that the economy had sufficient un-
derlying strength to support ongoing improvement in 
labor market conditions and a return of inflation to-
ward the Committee’s longer-run 2 percent objective, 
and thus agreed that a further measured reduction in 
the pace of the Committee’s asset purchases was ap-
propriate at this meeting.  Accordingly, the Committee 
agreed that beginning in July, it would add to its hold-
ings of agency MBS at a pace of $15 billion per month 
rather than $20 billion per month, and it would add to 
its holdings of Treasury securities at a pace of 
$20 billion per month rather than $25 billion per 
month.  Members again judged that, if incoming in-
formation broadly supported the Committee’s expecta-
tions for ongoing progress toward meeting its dual ob-
jectives of maximum employment and inflation of 
2 percent, the Committee would likely reduce the pace 
of asset purchases in further measured steps at future 
meetings.  The Committee reiterated, however, that 
purchases were not on a preset course, and that its de-
cisions about the pace of purchases would remain con-
tingent on its outlook for the labor market and inflation 
as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs 
of such purchases. 

The Committee agreed to maintain its target range for 
the federal funds rate and to reiterate its forward guid-
ance about how it would assess the appropriate timing 
of the first increase in the target rate and the anticipat-
ed behavior of the federal funds rate after it is raised.  
The guidance continued to emphasize that the Com-
mittee’s decisions about how long to maintain the cur-
rent target range for the federal funds rate would de-
pend on its assessment of actual and expected progress 
toward its objectives of maximum employment and 
2 percent inflation.  The Committee again stated that it 

Page 10Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ 
 
 
 
currently anticipated that it likely would be appropriate 
to maintain the current target range for the federal 
funds rate for a considerable time after the asset pur-
chase program ends, especially if projected inflation 
continued to run below the Committee’s 2 percent 
longer-run goal, and provided that longer-term infla-
tion expectations remained well anchored.  The for-
ward guidance also reiterated the Committee’s expecta-
tion that even after employment and inflation are near 
mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, 
for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds 
rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the 
longer run. 

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee 
voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank 
of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to exe-
cute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the 
following domestic policy directive: 

“Consistent with its statutory mandate, the 
Federal Open Market Committee seeks 
monetary and financial conditions that will 
foster maximum employment and price sta-
bility.  In particular, the Committee seeks 
conditions in reserve markets consistent 
with federal funds trading in a range from 0 
to ¼ percent.  The Committee directs the 
Desk to undertake open market operations 
as necessary to maintain such conditions.  
Beginning in July, the Desk is directed to 
purchase longer-term Treasury securities at 
a pace of about $20 billion per month and 
to purchase agency mortgage-backed securi-
ties at a pace of about $15 billion per 
month.  The Committee also directs the 
Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon 
swap transactions as necessary to facilitate 
settlement of the Federal Reserve’s agency 
mortgage-backed 
securities 
transactions.  
The Committee directs the Desk to main-
tain its policy of rolling over maturing 
Treasury securities into new issues and its 
policy of reinvesting principal payments on 
all agency debt and agency mortgage-backed 
securities in agency mortgage-backed securi-
ties.  The System Open Market Account 
manager and the secretary will keep the 
Committee informed of ongoing develop-
ments regarding the System’s balance sheet 
that could affect the attainment over time 
of the Committee’s objectives of maximum 
employment and price stability.” 

The vote encompassed approval of the statement be-
low to be released at 2:00 p.m.: 

“Information received since the Federal 
Open Market Committee met in April indi-
cates that growth in economic activity has 
rebounded in recent months.  Labor market 
indicators generally showed further im-
provement. 
 The unemployment rate, 
though lower, remains elevated.  Household 
spending appears to be rising moderately 
and business fixed investment resumed its 
advance, while the recovery in the housing 
sector remained slow.  Fiscal policy is re-
straining economic growth, although the ex-
tent of restraint is diminishing.  Inflation 
has been running below the Committee’s 
longer-run objective, but longer-term infla-
tion expectations have remained stable. 

Consistent with its statutory mandate, the 
Committee seeks to foster maximum em-
ployment and price stability.  The Commit-
tee expects that, with appropriate policy ac-
commodation, economic activity will ex-
pand at a moderate pace and labor market 
conditions will continue to improve gradu-
ally, moving toward those the Committee 
judges consistent with its dual mandate.  
The Committee sees the risks to the out-
look for the economy and the labor market 
as nearly balanced. The Committee recog-
nizes that inflation persistently below its     
2 percent objective could pose risks to eco-
nomic performance, and it is monitoring in-
flation developments carefully for evidence 
that inflation will move back toward its ob-
jective over the medium term. 

The Committee currently judges that there 
is sufficient underlying strength 
in the 
broader economy to support ongoing im-
provement in labor market conditions.  In 
light of the cumulative progress toward 
maximum employment and the improve-
ment in the outlook for labor market condi-
tions since the inception of the current asset 
purchase program, the Committee decided 
to make a further measured reduction in the 
pace of its asset purchases.  Beginning in Ju-
ly, the Committee will add to its holdings of 
agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace 
of $15 billion per month rather than 

Minutes of the Meeting of June 17–18, 2014Page 11_____________________________________________________________________________________________ 
 
 
 
$20 billion per month, and will add to its 
holdings of longer-term Treasury securities 
at a pace of $20 billion per month rather 
than $25 billion per month.  The Commit-
tee is maintaining its existing policy of rein-
vesting principal payments from its holdings 
of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed 
securities in agency mortgage-backed securi-
ties and of rolling over maturing Treasury 
securities at auction.  The Committee’s siz-
able and still-increasing holdings of longer-
term securities should maintain downward 
pressure on longer-term interest rates, sup-
port mortgage markets, and help to make 
broader financial conditions more accom-
modative, which in turn should promote a 
stronger economic recovery and help to en-
sure that inflation, over time, is at the rate 
most consistent with the Committee’s dual 
mandate. 

The Committee will closely monitor incom-
ing information on economic and financial 
developments in coming months and will 
continue its purchases of Treasury and 
agency mortgage-backed securities, and em-
ploy its other policy tools as appropriate, 
until the outlook for the labor market has 
improved substantially in a context of price 
stability.  If incoming information broadly 
supports the Committee’s expectation of 
ongoing improvement in labor market con-
ditions and inflation moving back toward its 
longer-run objective, the Committee will 
likely reduce the pace of asset purchases in 
further measured steps at future meetings.  
However, asset purchases are not on a pre-
set course, and the Committee’s decisions 
about their pace will remain contingent on 
the Committee’s outlook for the labor mar-
ket and inflation as well as its assessment of 
the likely efficacy and costs of such pur-
chases. 

To support continued progress toward 
maximum employment and price stability, 
the Committee today reaffirmed its view 
that a highly accommodative stance of 
monetary policy remains appropriate. In de-
termining how long to maintain the current 
0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal 
funds rate, the Committee will assess pro-
gress—both realized and expected—toward 

its objectives of maximum employment and 
2 percent inflation.  This assessment will 
take into account a wide range of infor-
mation, including measures of labor market 
conditions, indicators of inflation pressures 
and inflation expectations, and readings on 
financial developments.  The Committee 
continues to anticipate, based on its assess-
ment of these factors, that it likely will be 
appropriate to maintain the current target 
range for the federal funds rate for a con-
siderable time after the asset purchase pro-
gram ends, especially if projected inflation 
continues to run below the Committee’s     
2 percent longer-run goal, and provided that 
longer-term inflation expectations remain 
well anchored. 

When the Committee decides to begin to 
remove policy accommodation, it will take a 
balanced approach consistent with its long-
er-run goals of maximum employment and 
inflation of 2 percent.  The Committee cur-
rently anticipates that, even after employ-
ment and 
inflation are near mandate-
consistent levels, economic conditions may, 
for some time, warrant keeping the target 
federal funds rate below levels the Commit-
tee views as normal in the longer run.”

Dudley, Lael Brainard, Stanley Fischer, Richard W. 
Fisher, Narayana Kocherlakota, Loretta J. Mester, 
Charles I. Plosser, Jerome H. Powell, and Daniel K. 
Tarullo. 

Voting against this action:  None. 

It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee 
would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, July 29–30.

Summary of Economic Projections 

In conjunction with the June 17–18, 2014, Federal 
Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, meeting 
participants submitted their assessments of real output 
growth, the unemployment rate, inflation, and the tar-
get federal funds rate for each year from 2014 through 
2016 and over the longer run.1  Each participant’s as-
sessment was based on information available at the 
time of the meeting plus his or her judgment of appro-
priate monetary policy and assumptions about the fac-
tors likely to affect economic outcomes.  The longer-
run projections represent each participant’s judgment 
of the value to which each variable would be expected 
to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary 
policy and in the absence of further shocks to the 
economy.  “Appropriate monetary policy” is defined as 
the future path of policy that each participant deems 
most likely to foster outcomes for economic activity 
and inflation that best satisfy his or her individual in-
terpretation of the Federal Reserve’s objectives of max-
imum employment and stable prices  

Overall, FOMC participants expected that, under ap-
propriate monetary policy, economic growth would

pick up notably in the second half of 2014 and remain 
in 2015 and 2016 above their estimates of the longer-
run normal rate of economic growth.  Consistent with 
that outlook, the unemployment rate was projected to 
continue to decline toward its longer-run normal level 
over the projection period (table 1 and figure 1).  The 
majority of participants projected that inflation, as 
measured by the annual change in the price index for 
personal consumption expenditures (PCE), would rise 
to a level at or slightly below the Committee’s 2 percent 
objective in 2016. 

The majority of participants expected that highly ac-
commodative monetary policy would remain appropri-
ate over the next few years to foster progress toward 
the Federal Reserve’s longer-run objectives.  As shown 
in figure 2, all but one of the participants anticipated 
that it would be appropriate to wait at least until 2015 
before beginning to increase the federal funds rate, and 
most projected that it would then be appropriate to 
raise the target federal funds rate fairly gradually.  Giv-
en their economic outlooks, most participants judged 
that it would be appropriate to continue gradually slow-
ing the pace of the Committee’s purchases of longer-
term securities and complete the asset purchase pro-
gram later this year. 

Most participants saw the uncertainty associated with 
their outlooks for economic growth, the unemploy-

    NOTE:  Projections of change in real gross domestic product (GDP) and projections for both measures of inflation are from the fourth quarter of the previous 
year to the fourth quarter of the year indicated.  PCE inflation and core PCE inflation are the percentage rates of change in, respectively, the price index for per-
sonal consumption expenditures (PCE) and the price index for PCE excluding food and energy.  Projections for the unemployment rate are for the average civil-
ian unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of the year indicated.  Each participant’s projections are based on his or her assessment of appropriate monetary 
policy.  Longer-run projections represent each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge under appropriate mone-
tary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy.  The March projections were made in conjunction with the meeting of the Federal Open Market 
Committee on March 18–19, 2014. 
   1.  The central tendency excludes the three highest and three lowest projections for each variable in each year. 
   2.  The range for a variable in a given year includes all participants’ projections, from lowest to highest, for that variable in that year. 
   3.  Longer-run projections for core PCE inflation are not collected.

appropriate monetary policy, the ﬁrst increase in the target federal funds rate from its current range of 0 to 1/4 percent
will occur in the speciﬁed calendar year. In March 2014, the numbers of FOMC participants who judged that the ﬁrst
increase in the target federal funds rate would occur in 2014, 2015, and 2016 were, respectively, 1, 13, and 2. In the lower
panel, each shaded circle indicates the value (rounded to the nearest 1/4 percentage point) of an individual participant’s

Summary of Economic Projections of the Meeting of June 17–18, 2014Page 3_____________________________________________________________________________________________ment rate, and inflation as similar to that of the past   
20 years.  In addition, most participants considered the 
risks to the outlook for real GDP growth and the un-
employment rate to be broadly balanced, and a majority 
saw the risks to inflation as broadly balanced.  Howev-
er, some saw the risks to their forecasts for economic 
growth or inflation as tilted to the downside, and a 
couple saw the risks to their forecasts for inflation as 
tilted to the upside. 

The Outlook for Economic Activity 
Participants generally projected that, conditional on 
their individual assumptions about appropriate mone-
tary policy, real GDP growth would pick up notably in 
the second half of this year and remain in 2015 and 
2016 above their estimates of the longer-run normal 
rate of output growth.  All participants revised down 
their projections of real GDP growth for the first half 
of 2014 compared with their projections in March, but 
most left their forecasts for the remainder of the pro-
jection period largely unchanged.  Participants generally 
judged that real GDP growth in the first half of this 
year was held down by transitory factors depressing 
output early in the year, and they pointed to a number 
of factors that they expected would continue to con-
tribute to a pickup in economic growth later this year 
and next, including rising household net worth, dimin-
ished restraint from fiscal policy, improving labor mar-
ket conditions, and highly accommodative monetary 
policy.  The central tendencies of participants’ projec-
tions for real GDP growth were 2.1 to 2.3 percent in 
2014, 3.0 to 3.2 percent in 2015, and 2.5 to 3.0 percent 
in 2016.  The central tendency for the longer-run nor-
mal rate of growth of real GDP was 2.1 to 2.3 percent, 
only slightly lower than in March. 

Participants continued to anticipate a gradual decline in 
the unemployment rate over the projection period.  
The central tendencies of participants’ forecasts for the 
unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of each year 
were 6.0 to 6.1 percent in 2014, 5.4 to 5.7 percent in 
2015, and 5.1 to 5.5 percent in 2016.  Nearly all partici-
pants revised down their projected paths for the unem-
ployment rate this year and next relative to their March 
projections, with the majority pointing to the decline in 
the unemployment rate in recent months as a reason 
for the downward revision.  The central tendency of 
participants’ estimates of the longer-run normal rate of 
unemployment that would prevail under appropriate 
monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks 
to the economy also edged down, to 5.2 to 5.5 percent.  
Most participants projected that the unemployment 
rate would be close to their individual estimates of its 
longer-run level at the end of 2016. 

Figures 3.A and 3.B show that participants continued 
to hold a range of views regarding the likely outcomes 
for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate over 
the next two years.  The diversity of views reflected 
their individual assessments of the rate at which the 
headwinds that have been holding back the pace of the 
economic recovery would abate and of the anticipated 
path for foreign economic activity, the trajectory for 
growth in household net worth, and the appropriate 
path of monetary policy.  Relative to March, the disper-
sion of participants’ projections for real GDP growth 
narrowed a bit in 2014 but was largely unchanged over 
the next two years, and the dispersion of projections 
for the unemployment rate over the entire projection 
period was little changed. 

The Outlook for Inflation 
Compared with March, the central tendencies of partic-
ipants’ projections for inflation were largely unchanged 
for all years in the projection period, although many 
participants marked up a bit their projections for infla-
tion in 2014.  The vast majority of participants antici-
pated that, on average, both headline and core inflation 
would rise gradually over the next few years, and the 
majority of participants expected headline inflation to 
be at or slightly below the Committee’s 2 percent ob-
jective in 2016.  Specifically, the central tendencies for 
PCE inflation were 1.5 to 1.7 percent in 2014, 1.5 to 
2.0 percent in 2015, and 1.6 to 2.0 percent in 2016.  
The central tendencies of the forecasts for core infla-
tion were broadly similar to those for the headline 
measure.  It was noted that some combination of stable 
inflation expectations and steadily diminishing resource 
slack was likely to contribute to a gradual rise of infla-
tion back toward the Committee’s longer-run objective 
of 2 percent. 

Figures 3.C and 3.D provide information on the diver-
sity of participants’ views about the outlook for infla-
tion.  The ranges of participants’ projections for overall 
inflation were little changed relative to March.  The 
forecasts for PCE inflation in 2016 were at or below 
the Committee’s longer-run objective.  Similar to the 
projections for headline inflation, the projections for 
core inflation in 2016 were concentrated at or below    
2 percent. 

Appropriate Monetary Policy 
As indicated in figure 2, nearly all participants judged 
that low levels of the federal funds rate would remain 
appropriate for the next few years.  In particular,        
12 participants thought that the first increase in the 
target federal funds rate would not be warranted until 
sometime in 2015, and 3 judged that policy firming

ticipant thought that an increase in the federal funds 
rate would be warranted in 2014. 

All participants projected that the unemployment rate 
would be below 6 percent at the end of the year in 
which they judged the initial increase in the federal 
funds rate to be warranted, and all but one anticipated 
that inflation would be at or below the Committee’s 
longer-run objective at that time.  Most participants 
projected that the unemployment rate would remain 
above their estimates of its longer-run normal level at 
the end of the year in which they saw the federal funds 
rate increasing from its effective lower bound. 

Figure 3.E provides the distribution of participants’ 
judgments regarding the appropriate level of the target 
federal funds rate at the end of each calendar year from 
2014 to 2016 and over the longer run.  As noted earlier, 
nearly all participants judged that economic conditions 
would warrant maintaining the current exceptionally 
low level of the federal funds rate at least until 2015.  
Relative to their projections in March, the median val-
ues of the federal funds rate at the end of 2015 and 
2016 increased 13 basis points and 25 basis points to 
1.13 percent and 2.50 percent, respectively, while the 
mean values rose 7 basis points and 11 basis points to 
1.18 percent and 2.53 percent, respectively.  The dis-
persion of projections for the value of the federal funds 
rate was little changed in 2015 but widened slightly in 
2016.  Most participants expected that the federal funds 
rate at the end of 2016 would still be significantly below 
their individual assessments of its longer-run level.  For 
about half of these participants, the low level of the 
federal funds rate at that time was associated with infla-
tion well below the Committee’s 2 percent objective.  
In contrast, the rest of these participants saw the feder-
al funds rate at the end of 2016 as still significantly low 
despite their projections that the unemployment rate 
would be close to or below their individual longer-run 
projections and inflation would be at or close to 2 per-
cent at that time.  These participants cited some com-
bination of a lower equilibrium real interest rate, con-
tinuing headwinds from the financial crisis and subse-
quent recession, and a desire to raise the federal funds 
rate at a gradual pace after liftoff as explanations for 
the still-low level of the projected federal funds rate at 
the end of 2016.  A couple of participants also men-
tioned broader measures of labor market slack that may 
take longer to return to their normal levels than the 
unemployment rate.  Estimates of the longer-run level 
of the federal funds rate ranged from 3¼ to about    
4¼ percent, reflecting the Committee’s inflation objec-
tive of 2 percent and participants’ individual judgments 

regarding the appropriate longer-run level of the real 
federal funds rate in the absence of further shocks to 
the economy.  Compared with March, some partici-
pants revised down their estimates of the longer-run 
federal funds rate, with a lower assessment of the long-
er-run level of potential output growth cited as a con-
tributing factor for the majority of those revisions.  As 
a result, the median estimate of the longer-run federal 
funds rate shifted down to 3.75 percent from 4 percent 
in March, while its mean value declined 11 basis points 
to 3.78 percent. 

Participants also described their views regarding the 
appropriate path of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.  
Conditional on their respective economic outlooks, 
most participants judged that it would be appropriate 
to continue to reduce the pace of the Committee’s pur-
chases of longer-term securities in measured steps and 
to conclude the purchases later this year.  A couple of 
participants judged that a more rapid reduction in the 
pace of purchases and an earlier end to the asset pur-
chase program would be appropriate. 

Participants’ views of the appropriate path for mone-
tary policy were informed by their judgments about the 
state of the economy, including the values of the un-
employment rate and other labor market indicators that 
would be consistent with maximum employment, the 
extent to which the economy was currently falling short 
of maximum employment, the prospects for inflation 
to return to the Committee’s longer-term objective of  
2 percent, and the balance of risks around the outlook.  
Many participants also mentioned the prescriptions of 
various monetary policy rules as factors they consid-
ered in judging the appropriate path for the federal 
funds rate. 

Uncertainty and Risks 
The vast majority of participants continued to judge the 
levels of uncertainty about their projections for real 
GDP growth and the unemployment rate as broadly 
similar to the norms during the previous 20 years (fig-
ure 4).  Most participants continued to judge the risks 
to real GDP growth and the unemployment rate to be  

 Table 2 provides estimates of the forecast uncertainty for 
the change in real GDP, the unemployment rate, and total 
consumer price inflation over the period from 1994 through

the risks as weighted to the downside, reflecting, for 
example, their concerns about the limited ability of 
monetary policy at the zero lower bound to respond to 
negative shocks to the economy as well as external 
economic and geopolitical risks.  Similar to March, 
nearly all participants continued to judge the risks to 
the unemployment rate to be broadly balanced. 

Almost all participants saw the level of uncertainty and 
the balance of risks around their forecasts for overall 
PCE inflation and core inflation as little changed from 
March.  Most participants continued to judge the levels 
of uncertainty associated with their forecasts for the 
two inflation measures to be broadly similar to histori-
cal norms, and a majority continued to see the risks to 
those projections as broadly balanced.  A few partici-
pants, however, viewed the risks to their inflation fore-
casts as tilted to the downside, reflecting, for example, 
the possibilities that the recent low levels of inflation 
could prove more persistent than anticipated, and that 
the upward pull on prices from inflation expectations 
might be weaker than assumed.  Conversely, two par-
ticipants saw upside risks to inflation, with one citing 
uncertainty about the timing and efficacy of the Com-
mittee’s withdrawal of accommodation.

NOTE:  Error ranges shown are measured as plus or minus the root 
mean squared error of projections for 1994 through 2013 that were 
released in the spring by various private and government forecasters.  As 
described in the box “Forecast Uncertainty,” under certain assumptions, 
there is about a 70 percent probability that actual outcomes for real 
GDP, unemployment, and consumer prices will be in ranges implied by 
the average size of projection errors made in the past.  For more infor-
mation, see David Reifschneider and Peter Tulip (2007), “Gauging the 
Uncertainty of the Economic Outlook from Historical Forecasting Er-
rors,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2007-60 (Washington:  
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, November), availa-
ble at http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2007/200760/200760 
abs.html ; and Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Divi-
sion of Research and Statistics (2014), “Updated Historical Forecast 
Errors,” memorandum, April 9, http://www.federalreserve.gov/foia/

1.   Definitions of variables are in the general note to table 1. 
2.  Measure is the overall consumer price index, the price measure 
that has been most widely used in government and private economic 
forecasts.  Projection is percent change, fourth quarter of the previous 
year to the fourth quarter of the year indicated.

Forecast Uncertainty 

The economic projections provided by 
the members of the Board of Governors and 
the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks 
inform discussions of monetary policy among 
policymakers and can aid public understand-
ing of the basis for policy actions.  Consider-
able uncertainty attends these projections, 
however.  The economic and statistical models 
and relationships used to help produce eco-
nomic forecasts are necessarily imperfect de-
scriptions of the real world, and the future 
path of the economy can be affected by myr-
iad unforeseen developments and events.  
Thus, in setting the stance of monetary policy, 
participants consider not only what appears to 
be the most likely economic outcome as em-
bodied in their projections, but also the range 
of alternative possibilities, the likelihood of 
their occurring, and the potential costs to the 
economy should they occur. 
Table 2 summarizes the average historical 
accuracy of a range of forecasts, including 
those reported in past Monetary Policy Reports 
and those prepared by the Federal Reserve 
Board’s staff in advance of meetings of the 
Federal Open Market Committee.  The pro-
jection error ranges shown in the table il-
lustrate the considerable uncertainty associat-
ed with economic forecasts.  For example, 
suppose a participant projects that real gross 
domestic product (GDP) and total consumer 
prices will rise steadily at annual rates of, re-
spectively, 3 percent and 2 percent.  If the 
uncertainty attending those projections is simi-
lar to that experienced in the past and the risks 
around the projections are broadly balanced, 
the numbers reported in table 2 would imply a 
probability of about 70 percent that actual 
GDP  would expand  within a range of  1.6  to 

4.4 percent in the current year, 1.0 to 5.0 per-
cent in the second year, and 0.9 to 5.1 percent 
in the third year.  The corresponding 70 percent 
confidence intervals for overall inflation would 
be 1.2 to 2.8 percent in the current year and    
1.0 to 3.0 percent in the second and third years. 
Because current conditions may differ 
from those that prevailed, on average, over his-
tory, participants provide judgments as to 
whether the uncertainty attached to their pro-
jections of each variable is greater than, smaller 
than, or broadly similar to typical levels of 
forecast uncertainty in the past, as shown in 
table 2.  Participants also provide judgments as 
to whether the risks to their projections are 
weighted to the upside, are weighted to the 
downside, or are broadly balanced.  That is, 
participants judge whether each variable is 
more likely to be above or below their projec-
tions of the most likely outcome.  These judg-
ments about the uncertainty and the risks at-
tending each participant’s projections are dis-
tinct from the diversity of participants’ views 
about the most likely outcomes.  Forecast un-
certainty is concerned with the risks associated 
with a particular projection rather than with 
divergences across a number of different pro-
jections. 
As with real activity and inflation, the out-
look for the future path of the federal funds 
rate is subject to considerable uncertainty.  This 
uncertainty arises primarily because each partic-
ipant’s assessment of the appropriate stance of 
monetary policy depends importantly on the 
evolution of real activity and inflation over 
time.  If economic conditions evolve in an un-
expected manner, then assessments of the ap-
propriate setting of the federal funds rate 
would change from that point forward.
