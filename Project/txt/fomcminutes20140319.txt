Developments 
in Financial Markets and the 
Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet 

The manager of the System Open Market Account 
(SOMA) reported on developments in domestic and 
foreign financial markets as well as the System open 
market operations during the period since the Federal 
Open Market Committee (FOMC) met on January 28–
29, 2014.  By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified 
the Open Market Desk’s domestic transactions over 
the intermeeting period.  There were no intervention 
operations in foreign currencies for the System’s 
account over the intermeeting period. 

Staff Review of the Economic Situation 

The information reviewed for the March 1819 meet-
ing indicated that economic growth slowed early this 
year, likely only in part because of the temporary effects 
of the unusually cold and snowy winter weather.  Total 
payroll employment expanded further, while the unem-
ployment rate held steady, on balance, and was still ele-
vated.  Consumer price inflation continued to run be-
low 
the Committee’s 
longer-run objective, but 
measures of longer-run inflation expectations remained 
stable.   
Total nonfarm payroll employment rose in January and 
February at a slower pace than in the fourth quarter of 
last year.  The unemployment rate was 6.7 percent in 
February, the same as in December of last year.  The 
labor 
force participation 
rate, along with 
the            
employment-to-population ratio, increased, on net, in 
recent months.  Both the share of workers employed 
part time for economic reasons and the rate of long-
duration unemployment were lower in February than 
they were late last year, although both measures were 
still high.  Initial claims for unemployment insurance 
were little changed over the intermeeting period.  The 

rate of job openings stepped down, while the rate of 
hiring was unchanged in December and January.  
Manufacturing production was roughly flat, on balance, 
in January and February, in part because of the effects 
of the severe winter weather, which held down both 
motor vehicle output and production outside the motor 
vehicle sector.  Automakers’ production schedules indi-
cated that the pace of light motor vehicle assemblies 
would increase in the second quarter, and broader indi-
cators of manufacturing production, such as the read-
ings on new orders from national manufacturing sur-
veys, were consistent with an expectation of moderate 
expansion in factory output in the coming months.  
Real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) in-
creased a little, on net, in December and January.  
However, the components of the nominal retail sales 
data used by the Bureau of Economic Analysis to con-
struct its estimate of PCE rose at a faster rate in Febru-
ary than in the previous couple of months, and light 
motor vehicle sales also moved up.  Recent information 
on key factors that influence household spending, 
along with the expectation that the weather would re-
turn to seasonal norms, generally pointed toward addi-
tional gains in PCE in the coming months.  House-
holds’ net worth probably continued to expand as equi-
ty prices and home values increased further, and con-
sumer sentiment in the Thomson Reuters/University 
of Michigan Surveys of Consumers during February 
and early March remained above its average last fall; 
however, real disposable incomes only edged up, on 
balance, in December and January. 
The pace of activity in the housing sector appeared to 
soften.  Starts for both new single-family homes and 
multifamily units were lower in January and February 
than at the end of last year.  Permits for single-family 
homes—which are typically less sensitive to fluctua-
tions in the weather and a better indicator of the under-
lying pace of construction—also moved down in those 
months and had not shown a sustained improvement 
since last spring when mortgage rates began to rise.  
Sales of existing homes decreased in January and pend-
ing home sales were little changed, although new home 
sales expanded. 
Growth in real private expenditures for business 
equipment and intellectual property products stepped 
up in the fourth quarter to a faster rate than in the third 
quarter.  In January, nominal shipments of nondefense 
capital goods excluding aircraft decreased slightly.  
However, new orders for these capital goods increased 
and remained above the level of shipments in January, 

Page 2Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ 
 
 
 
pointing to increases in shipments in subsequent 
months.  Other forward-looking indicators, such as 
surveys of business conditions, also were generally con-
sistent with modest increases in business equipment 
spending in the near term.  Real business spending for 
nonresidential structures was essentially unchanged in 
the fourth quarter, and nominal expenditures for such 
structures were flat in January.  Real nonfarm inventory 
investment increased at a significantly slower pace in 
the fourth quarter than in the preceding quarter, and 
recent data on the book value of inventories, along 
with readings on inventories from national and regional 
manufacturing surveys, did not point to significant in-
ventory imbalances in most industries; however, days’ 
supply of light motor vehicles in January and February 
exceeded the automakers’ targets. 
Federal spending data in January and February pointed 
toward real federal government purchases being rough-
ly flat in the first quarter, as the general downtrend in 
purchases seemed likely to be about offset by a reversal 
of the effects of the partial government shutdown dur-
ing the fourth quarter.  Total real state and local gov-
ernment purchases also appeared to be about flat going 
into the first quarter.  The payrolls of these govern-
ments expanded somewhat, on balance, in January and 
February, but nominal state and local construction ex-
penditures declined a little in January. 
The U.S. international trade deficit, after widening in 
December, remained about unchanged in January.  Ex-
ports increased in January, but the gains were modest 
as decreases in sales of cars, petroleum products, and 
agricultural goods were just offset by gains in other 
major categories.  Imports also rose in January as the 
increase in the volume of oil imports more than offset 
declines in imports of non-oil goods and services. 
Total U.S. consumer price inflation, as measured by the 
PCE price index, was about 1¼ percent over the        
12 months ending in January, continuing to run below 
the Committee’s longer-run objective of 2 percent.  
Over the same 12-month period, consumer energy 
prices rose faster than total consumer prices while con-
sumer food prices only edged up, and core PCE pric-
es—which exclude food and energy prices—increased 
just a bit more than 1 percent.  In February, the con-
sumer price index (CPI) rose at a pace similar to that 
seen in recent months, as food prices rose more quick-
ly, energy prices declined, and the increase in the core 
CPI remained slow.  Both near- and longer-term infla-
tion expectations from the Michigan survey were little 
changed in February and early March. 

Measures of labor compensation indicated that increas-
es in nominal wages remained subdued.  Compensation 
per hour in the nonfarm business sector increased 
slightly over the year ending in the fourth quarter, and, 
with some gains in labor productivity, unit labor costs 
declined a little.  Over the same year-long period, the 
employment cost index and average hourly earnings for 
all employees rose only a little faster than consumer 
price inflation. 
Foreign real gross domestic product (GDP) expanded 
at a moderate pace in the fourth quarter of 2013, with 
weak economic growth in Japan and Mexico offsetting 
stronger gains in many other economies.  Recent indi-
cators suggested that total foreign real GDP was ex-
panding at a similar pace in the first quarter of 2014.  
The economic recovery in the euro area appeared to be 
continuing, and the pace of Japanese economic growth 
looked to have picked up.  In Canada, however, severe 
winter weather appeared to have held down economic 
activity in early 2014.  Among the emerging market 
economies (EMEs), recent data suggested that eco-
nomic growth in China was slowing in the first quarter, 
and that the rate of growth in the other Asian econo-
mies was also declining from a very robust fourth-
quarter pace.  Mexican real GDP growth slowed sharp-
ly in the fourth quarter, led by a contraction in the 
manufacturing sector, but recent indicators, such as 
auto production, suggested some rebound in the pace 
of economic activity in the current quarter.  Inflation 
increased slightly in some advanced economies but re-
mained well below central banks’ targets.  At the same 
time, inflation declined in some emerging Asian econ-
omies.  Monetary policy remained highly accommoda-
tive in the advanced foreign economies.  Across the 
EMEs, monetary policy adjustments varied according 
to economic and financial developments, with some 
central banks tightening policy and others loosening it. 

Staff Review of the Financial Situation 

Financial market conditions in the United States over 
the intermeeting period appeared to have been influ-
enced by an easing of concerns about developments in 
the EMEs but relatively little affected by the generally 
weaker-than-expected economic data, which market 
participants appeared to attribute in large part to the 
temporary effects of unusually severe winter weather.  
On balance, U.S. financial conditions remained sup-
portive of growth in economic activity and employ-
ment:  The expected path of the federal funds rate was 
little changed, longer-term yields on Treasury securities 
edged down, equity prices rose, speculative-grade cor-

Minutes of the Meeting of March 18–19, 2014Page 3_____________________________________________________________________________________________porate bond spreads narrowed, and the foreign ex-
change value of the dollar depreciated slightly. 
FOMC communications over the intermeeting period 
were about in line with market expectations.  The 
FOMC decision and statement in January were largely 
anticipated by market participants.  The Monetary Policy 
Report and Chair Yellen’s accompanying congressional 
testimony in February were viewed as emphasizing 
continuity in the approach to monetary policy, solidify-
ing expectations that the pace of the Committee’s asset 
purchases would be reduced by a further $10 billion at 
each upcoming meeting absent a material change in the 
economic outlook. 
Results from the Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers for 
March indicated that the dealers’ expectations about 
both the likely future path of the federal funds rate and 
Federal Reserve asset purchases were largely unchanged 
since January.  The survey results showed that most 
dealers expected the Committee to modify its forward 
rate guidance at the March meeting, with many antici-
pating a shift toward qualitative guidance. 
Yields on short- and intermediate-term Treasury securi-
ties were little changed, on balance, over the intermeet-
ing period, as the effects of a waning of flight-to-quality 
demands early in the period roughly offset those of 
generally weaker-than-expected economic data.  Yields 
on 
longer-term Treasury securities edged down.  
Measures of longer-horizon inflation compensation 
based on Treasury inflation-protected securities also 
declined somewhat. 
The Federal Reserve continued its fixed-rate overnight 
reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) exercise.  
Early in the intermeeting period, market rates on re-
purchase agreements were close to the fixed rate of-
fered in the exercise, prompting high take-up in the 
ON RRP operations.  The increases in the interest rate 
offered by the Federal Reserve in its ON RRP exercise, 
along with the increases in caps for individual bids, also 
may have contributed to higher levels of activity at daily 
operations.  Later in the period, market rates on repur-
chase agreements moved higher, apparently in response 
to a rise in Treasury bill issuance, and ON RRP vol-
umes moderated.  Reflecting the larger size of the ON 
RRP exercises and the reduced pace of asset purchases, 
the rate of increase in the monetary base slowed over 
January and February. 
Conditions in unsecured short-term dollar funding 
markets remained stable over the intermeeting period.  
Responses to the March 2014 Senior Credit Officer 
Opinion Survey on Dealer Financing Terms suggested 

little change over the past three months in conditions 
in securities financing and over-the-counter derivatives 
markets and in credit terms applicable to most classes 
of counterparties. 
Broad stock price indexes rose over the intermeeting 
period, apparently boosted by a solid finish to the cor-
porate earnings season.  Equity prices were also sup-
ported by a broad increase in investors’ willingness to 
take riskier positions, in part likely reflecting an easing 
of concerns about EMEs early in the period. 
Credit flows to nonfinancial corporations remained 
robust.  Following a slowdown in January, nonfinancial 
corporate bond issuance rebounded in February, with 
the majority of proceeds going to investment-grade 
firms.  The growth of commercial and industrial loans 
on banks’ balance sheets increased over the period.  
Institutional issuance of leveraged loans continued at a 
brisk pace. 
Financing conditions in the commercial real estate 
(CRE) sector continued to improve gradually.  In the 
fourth quarter, banks’ CRE loans increased across all 
major loan categories, and CRE loans on banks’ books 
advanced at a solid pace in the first two months of the 
year.  Issuance of commercial mortgage-backed securi-
ties was robust in February after a slow start in January. 
Conditions in the municipal bond market remained 
favorable over the intermeeting period with the spread 
of municipal yields over yields on comparable-maturity 
Treasury securities little changed.  Although Puerto 
Rico’s general obligation (GO) bonds were downgrad-
ed from investment grade to speculative grade, prices 
of these bonds held steady, albeit at depressed levels.  
Puerto Rico successfully brought to market a GO bond 
issue in early March, substantially easing its near-term 
liquidity pressures. 
House prices registered a further notable rise in Janu-
ary.  Mortgage interest rates and their spreads over 
Treasury yields were little changed over the intermeet-
ing period.  Both mortgage applications for home pur-
chases and refinancing applications remained at low 
levels through early March.  Financing conditions in 
residential mortgage markets stayed tight, even as fur-
ther incremental signs of easing emerged. 
Conditions in consumer credit markets were still 
mixed.  Auto loans continued to be broadly available, 
while credit card limits for borrowers with subprime 
and prime credit scores remained at low levels in the 
fourth quarter.  Partly reflecting these conditions, credit 
card balances stayed about flat through January, while 

Page 4Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________auto and student loans continued to expand briskly.  
Issuance of auto and credit card asset-backed securities 
was robust again in January and February. 
Financial market sentiment abroad appeared to im-
prove over the period, particularly with respect to the 
stresses that had developed in some EMEs just prior to 
the January FOMC meeting.  Although global equity 
price indexes fell abruptly on March 3 amid the deep-
ening of the political crisis in Ukraine, most markets 
quickly retraced those losses.  Consistent with the gen-
eral improvement in financial market sentiment, most 
foreign currencies appreciated against the dollar as 
flight-to-safety flows reversed.  One notable exception 
was the Chinese renminbi, which depreciated against 
the dollar.  The performance of foreign equity price 
indexes was mixed, on net:  Stock prices rose in the 
EMEs, but they were flat in Europe and declined sub-
stantially in Japan.  Longer-term sovereign bond yields 
in the advanced economies fell modestly over the peri-
od. 

Staff Economic Outlook 

In the economic forecast prepared by the staff for the 
March FOMC meeting, real GDP growth in the first 
half of this year was somewhat lower than in the pro-
jection for the January meeting.  The available readings 
on consumer spending, residential construction, and 
business investment pointed to less spending growth in 
the first quarter than the staff had previously expected.  
The staff’s assessment was that the unusually severe 
winter weather could account for some, but not all, of 
the recent unanticipated weakness in economic activity, 
and the staff lowered its projection for near-term out-
put growth.  Largely because of the combination of 
recent downward surprises in the unemployment rate 
and weaker-than-expected real GDP growth, the staff 
lowered slightly the assumed pace of potential output 
growth in recent years and over the projection period.  
As a result, the staff’s medium-term forecast for real 
GDP growth also was revised down slightly.  Never-
theless, the staff continued to project that real GDP 
would expand at a faster pace over the next few years 
than it did last year, and that real GDP growth would 
exceed the growth rate of potential output.  The faster 
pace of real GDP growth was expected to be support-
ed by an easing in the restraint from changes in fiscal 
policy, increases in consumer and business confidence, 
further improvements in credit availability and financial 
conditions, and a pickup in the rate of foreign econom-
ic growth.  The expansion in economic activity was 
anticipated to lead to a slow reduction in resource slack 
over the projection period, and the unemployment rate 

was expected to decline gradually to the staff’s estimate 
of its longer-run natural rate. 
The staff’s forecast for inflation was basically un-
changed from the projection prepared for the previous 
FOMC meeting.  The staff continued to forecast that 
inflation would stay below the Committee’s longer-run 
objective of 2 percent over the next few years.  Infla-
tion was projected to rise gradually toward the Com-
mittee’s objective, as longer-run inflation expectations 
were assumed to remain stable, changes in commodity 
and import prices were expected to be subdued, and 
slack in labor and product markets was anticipated to 
diminish slowly. 
The staff’s economic projections for the March meet-
ing were quite similar to its forecasts presented at the 
December meeting when the FOMC last prepared a 
Summary of Economic Projections (SEP).  The staff’s 
March projections for both real GDP growth and the 
unemployment rate over the next few years were just 
slightly lower than in its December forecasts, while the 
inflation projection was essentially unchanged. 
The staff viewed the extent of uncertainty around its 
March projections for real GDP growth and the unem-
ployment rate as roughly in line with the average of the 
past 20 years.  Nonetheless, the risks to the forecast for 
real GDP growth were viewed as tilted a little to the 
downside, especially because the economy was not well 
positioned to withstand adverse shocks while the target 
for the federal funds rate was at its effective lower 
bound.  At the same time, the staff viewed the risks 
around its outlook for the unemployment rate and for 
inflation as roughly balanced. 

Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the 
Economic Outlook  

In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, the meeting 
participants—the 4 members of the Board of Gover-
nors and the presidents of the 12 Federal Reserve 
Banks, all of whom participated in the deliberations—
submitted their assessments of real output growth, the 
unemployment rate, inflation, and the target federal 
funds rate for each year from 2014 through 2016 and 
over the longer run, under each participant’s judgment 
of appropriate monetary policy. The longer-run projec-
tions represent each participant’s assessment of the rate 
to which each variable would be expected to converge, 
over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in 
the absence of further shocks to the economy. These 
economic projections and policy assessments are de-
scribed in the SEP, which is attached as an addendum 
to these minutes.  

Minutes of the Meeting of March 18–19, 2014Page 5_____________________________________________________________________________________________In their discussion of the economic situation and the 
outlook, participants generally noted that data released 
since their January meeting had indicated somewhat 
slower-than-expected growth in economic activity dur-
ing the winter months, in part reflecting adverse weath-
er conditions.  Labor market indicators were mixed.  
Inflation had continued to run below the Committee’s 
longer-run objective, but longer-term inflation expecta-
tions had remained stable.  Several participants indicat-
ed that recent economic news, although leading them 
to mark down somewhat their estimates of economic 
growth in late 2013 as well as their assessments of likely 
growth in the first quarter of 2014, had not prompted a 
significant revision of their projections of moderate 
economic growth over coming quarters. 
Most participants noted that unusually severe winter 
weather had held down economic activity during the 
early months of the year.  Business contacts in various 
parts of the country reported a number of weather-
induced disruptions, including reduced manufacturing 
activity due to lost workdays, interruptions to supply 
chains of inputs and delivery of final products, and 
lower-than-expected retail sales.  Participants expected 
economic activity to pick up as the weather-related dis-
ruptions to spending and production dissipated.  A few 
participants, however, highlighted factors other than 
weather that had likely contributed to the slowdown 
during the first quarter, including slower growth in net 
exports following its unusually large positive contribu-
tion to growth in the fourth quarter of 2013.  Moreo-
ver, it was noted that some of the pickup in economic 
growth that had appeared to have been indicated by the 
data available at the January meeting had been reversed 
by subsequent data revisions.  For many participants, 
the outlook for economic activity over coming quarters 
had changed little, on balance, since the time of the 
December meeting. 
Housing activity remained slow over the intermeeting 
period.  Although unfavorable weather had contributed 
to the recent disappointing performance of housing, a 
few participants suggested that last year’s rise in mort-
gage interest rates might have produced a larger-than-
expected reduction in home sales.  In addition, it was 
noted that the return of house prices to more-normal 
levels could be damping the pace of the housing recov-
ery, and that home affordability has been reduced for 
some prospective buyers.  Slackening demand from 
institutional investors was cited as another factor be-
hind the decline in home sales.  Nonetheless, the un-
derlying fundamentals, including population growth 

and household formation, were viewed as pointing to a 
continuing recovery of the housing market. 
In their discussion of labor market developments, par-
ticipants noted further improvement, on balance, in 
labor market conditions.  The unemployment rate had 
moved down in recent months, as had broader 
measures of unemployment and underemployment.  
Other labor market indicators, such as payrolls and 
hiring and quit rates, while not all showing the same 
extent of improvement, also pointed to ongoing gains 
in labor markets.  Going forward, participants contin-
ued to expect a gradual decline in the unemployment 
rate over the medium term, with judgments differing 
somewhat across participants about the likely pace of 
the decline.  It was also noted that uncertainty about 
the trend rate of productivity growth was making it 
difficult to ascertain the rate of real GDP growth that 
would be associated with progress in reducing the un-
employment rate. 
While there was general agreement that slack remains 
in the labor market, participants expressed a range of 
views regarding the amount of slack and how well the 
unemployment rate performs as a summary indicator of 
labor market conditions.  Several participants pointed 
to a number of factors—including the low labor force 
participation rate and the still-high rates of longer-
duration unemployment and of workers employed part 
time for economic reasons—as suggesting that there 
might be considerably more labor market slack than 
indicated by the unemployment rate alone.  A couple of 
other participants, however, saw reasons to believe that 
slack was more limited, viewing the decline in the par-
ticipation rate as primarily reflecting demographic 
trends with little role for cyclical factors and observing 
that broader measures of unemployment had registered 
declines in the past year that were comparable with the 
decline in the standard measure.  Several participants 
cited  low nominal wage growth as pointing to the ex-
istence of continued labor market slack.  Participants 
also noted the debate in the research literature and 
elsewhere concerning whether long-term unemploy-
ment differs materially from short-term unemployment 
in its implications for wage and price pressures. 
Inflation continued to run below the Committee’s        
2 percent longer-run objective over the intermeeting 
period.  A couple of participants expressed concern 
that inflation might not return to 2 percent in the next 
few years and suggested that a protracted period of 
inflation below 2 percent raised questions about 
whether the Committee was providing an appropriate 
degree of monetary accommodation.  One of these 

Page 6Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________participants suggested that persistently low inflation 
was a clear reflection of a sizable shortfall of employ-
ment from its maximum level.  A number of partici-
pants noted that a pickup in nominal wage growth 
would be consistent with labor market conditions mov-
ing closer to normal and would support the return of 
consumer price inflation to the Committee’s 2 percent 
longer-run goal.  However, a couple of other partici-
pants suggested that factors other than economic slack 
had played a notable role in holding down inflation of 
late, including unusually slow growth in prices of medi-
cal services.  Most participants expected inflation to 
return to 2 percent over the next few years, supported 
by stable inflation expectations and the continued 
gradual recovery in economic activity. 
Several participants pointed to international develop-
ments that bear watching.  It was suggested that slower 
growth in China had likely already put some downward 
pressure on world commodity prices, and a couple of 
participants observed that a larger-than-expected slow-
down in economic growth in China could have adverse 
implications for global economic growth.  In addition, 
it was noted that events in Ukraine were likely to have 
little direct effect on the U.S. economic outlook but 
might have negative implications for global growth if 
they escalated and led to a protracted period of geopo-
litical tensions in that region. 
In their discussion of recent financial developments, 
participants saw financial conditions as generally con-
sistent with the Committee’s policy intentions.  How-
ever, several participants mentioned trends that, if con-
tinued, could become a concern from the perspective 
of financial stability.  A couple of participants pointed 
to the decline in credit spreads to relatively low levels 
by historical standards; one of these participants noted 
the risk of either a sharp rise in spreads, which could 
have negative repercussions for aggregate demand, or a 
continuation of the decline in spreads, which could 
undermine financial stability over time.  One partici-
pant voiced concern about high levels of margin debt 
and of equity market valuations as well as a notable 
shift into commodity investments.  Another participant 
stressed the growth in consumer credit to less credit-
worthy households. 
In their discussion of monetary policy going forward, 
participants focused primarily on possible changes to 
the Committee’s forward guidance for the federal funds 
rate.  Almost all participants agreed that it was appro-
priate at this meeting to update the forward guidance, 
in part because the unemployment rate was seen as 
likely to fall below its 6½ percent threshold value be-

fore long.  Most participants preferred replacing the 
numerical thresholds with a qualitative description of 
the factors that would influence the Committee’s deci-
sion to begin raising the federal funds rate.  One partic-
ipant, however, favored retaining the existing threshold 
language on the grounds that removing it before the 
unemployment rate reached 6½ percent could be mis-
interpreted as a signal that the path of policy going 
forward would be less accommodative.  Another par-
ticipant favored introducing new quantitative thresh-
olds of 5½ percent for the unemployment rate and 2¼ 
percent for projected inflation.  A few participants pro-
posed adding new language in which the Committee 
would indicate its willingness to keep rates low if pro-
jected inflation remained persistently below the Com-
mittee’s 2 percent longer-run objective; these partici-
pants suggested that the inclusion of this quantitative 
element in the forward guidance would demonstrate 
the Committee’s commitment to defend its inflation 
objective from below as well as from above.  Other 
participants, however, judged that it was already well 
understood that the Committee recognizes that infla-
tion persistently below its 2 percent objective could 
pose risks to economic performance.  Most participants 
therefore did not favor adding new quantitative lan-
guage, preferring to shift to qualitative language that 
would describe the Committee’s likely reaction to the 
state of the economy. 
Most participants also believed that, as part of the pro-
cess of clarifying the Committee’s future policy inten-
tions, it would be appropriate at this time for the 
Committee to provide additional guidance 
in 
its 
postmeeting statement regarding the likely behavior of 
the federal funds rate after its first increase.  For exam-
ple, the statement could indicate that the Committee 
currently anticipates that, even after employment and 
inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic 
conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the 
target federal funds rate below levels the Committee 
views as normal in the longer run.  Participants ob-
served that a number of factors were likely to have con-
tributed to a persistent decline in the level of interest 
rates consistent with attaining and maintaining the 
Committee’s objectives.  In particular, participants cited 
higher precautionary savings by U.S. households fol-
lowing the financial crisis, higher global levels of sav-
ings, demographic changes, slower growth in potential 
output, and continued restraint on the availability of 
credit.  A few participants suggested that new language 
along these lines could instead be introduced when the 
first increase in the federal funds rate had drawn closer 
or after the Committee had further discussed the rea-

Minutes of the Meeting of March 18–19, 2014Page 7_____________________________________________________________________________________________sons for anticipating a relatively low federal funds rate 
during the period of policy firming.  A number of par-
ticipants noted the overall upward shift since Decem-
ber in participants’ projections of the federal funds rate 
included in the March SEP, with some expressing con-
cern that this component of the SEP could be miscon-
strued as indicating a move by the Committee to a less 
accommodative reaction function.  However, several 
participants noted that the increase in the median pro-
jection overstated the shift in the projections.  In addi-
tion, a number of participants observed that an upward 
shift was arguably warranted by the improvement in 
participants’ outlooks for the labor market since De-
cember and therefore need not be viewed as signifying 
a less accommodative reaction function.  Most partici-
pants favored providing an explicit indication in the 
statement that the new forward guidance, taken as a 
whole, did not imply a change in the Committee’s poli-
cy intentions, on the grounds that such an indication 
could help forestall misinterpretation of the new for-
ward guidance. 

Committee Policy Action 

Committee members saw the information received 
over the intermeeting period as indicating that growth 
in economic activity slowed during the winter months, 
in part reflecting adverse weather conditions.  Labor 
market indicators were mixed but on balance showed 
further improvement.  The unemployment rate, how-
ever, remained elevated when judged against members’ 
estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemploy-
ment.  Household spending and business fixed invest-
ment continued to advance, while the recovery in the 
housing sector remained slow.  Fiscal policy was re-
straining economic growth, although the extent of re-
straint had diminished.  The Committee expected that, 
with appropriate policy accommodation, the economy 
would expand at a moderate pace and labor market 
conditions would continue to improve gradually, mov-
ing toward those the Committee judges consistent with 
the dual mandate.  Moreover, members judged that the 
risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor 
market were nearly balanced.  Inflation was running 
below the Committee’s longer-run objective, and this 
was seen as posing possible risks to economic perfor-
mance, but members anticipated that stable inflation 
expectations and strengthening economic activity 
would, over time, return inflation to the Committee’s   
2 percent objective.  However, in light of their con-
cerns about the possible persistence of low inflation, 
members agreed that inflation developments should be 
monitored carefully for evidence that inflation was 

moving back toward the Committee’s longer-run objec-
tive. 
In their discussion of monetary policy in the period 
ahead, members agreed that there was sufficient under-
lying strength in the broader economy to support on-
going improvement in labor market conditions.  In 
light of the cumulative progress toward maximum em-
ployment and the improvement in the outlook for la-
bor market conditions since the inception of the cur-
rent asset purchase program, members decided that it 
would be appropriate to make a further measured re-
duction in the pace of its asset purchases at this meet-
ing.  Members again judged that, if the economy con-
tinued to develop as anticipated, the Committee would 
likely reduce the pace of asset purchases in further 
measured steps at future meetings.  Members also un-
derscored that the pace of asset purchases was not on a 
preset course and would remain contingent on the 
Committee’s outlook for the labor market and inflation 
as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs 
of purchases.  Accordingly, the Committee agreed that, 
beginning in April, it would add to its holdings of agen-
cy mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $25 billion 
per month rather than $30 billion per month, and 
would add to its holdings of longer-term Treasury secu-
rities at a pace of $30 billion per month rather than $35 
billion per month.  While making a further measured 
reduction in its pace of purchases, the Committee em-
phasized that its holdings of longer-term securities were 
sizable and would still be increasing, which would 
promote a stronger economic recovery by maintaining 
downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, sup-
porting mortgage markets, and helping to make broad-
er financial conditions more accommodative.  The 
Committee also reiterated that it would continue its 
asset purchases, and employ its other policy tools as 
appropriate, until the outlook for the labor market has 
improved substantially in a context of price stability.  
One member, while concurring with this policy action, 
suggested that in future statements the Committee 
might provide further information about the trajectory 
of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, including in-
formation about when the Committee might discontin-
ue its policy of reinvesting principal payments on all 
agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in 
agency mortgage-backed securities. 
With respect to forward guidance about the federal 
funds rate, all members judged that, as the unemploy-
ment rate was likely to fall below 6½ percent before 
long, it was appropriate to replace the existing quantita-
tive thresholds at this meeting.  Almost all members 

Page 8Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________judged that the new language should be qualitative in 
nature and should indicate that, in determining how 
long to maintain the current 0 to ¼ percent target 
range for the federal funds rate, the Committee would 
assess progress, both realized and expected, toward its 
objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent in-
flation.  However, a couple of members preferred to 
include language in the statement indicating that the 
Committee would keep rates low if projected inflation 
remained persistently below the Committee’s 2 percent 
longer-run objective.  One of these members argued 
that the Committee should continue to provide quanti-
tative thresholds for both the unemployment rate and 
inflation. 
Members also considered statement language that 
would provide information about the anticipated be-
havior of the federal funds rate once it is raised above 
its effective lower bound.  The Committee decided that 
it was appropriate to add language indicating that the 
Committee currently anticipates that, even after em-
ployment and inflation are near mandate-consistent 
levels, economic conditions may, for some time, war-
rant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels 
the Committee views as normal in the longer run.  In 
discussing this addition, a couple of members suggested 
that language along these lines might better be intro-
duced at a later meeting.  However, another member 
indicated that adding the new language at this stage 
could be beneficial for the effectiveness of policy be-
cause financial conditions depend on both the length of 
time that the federal funds rate is at the effective lower 
bound and on the expected path that the federal funds 
rate will follow once policy firming begins.  It was also 
noted that the postmeeting statements, rather than the 
SEP, provide the public with information on the 
Committee’s monetary policy decisions and that it was 
therefore appropriate for the postmeeting statement to 
convey the Committee’s position on the likely future 
behavior of the federal funds rate. 
At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee 
voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank 
of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to 
execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with 
the following domestic policy directive: 
“Consistent with its statutory mandate, the 
Federal Open Market Committee seeks 
monetary and financial conditions that will 
foster maximum employment and price 
stability.  In particular, the Committee seeks 
conditions in reserve markets consistent with 
federal funds trading in a range from 0 to     

¼ percent.  The Committee directs the Desk 
to undertake open market operations as 
necessary 
to maintain such conditions.  
Beginning in April, the Desk is directed to 
purchase longer-term Treasury securities at a 
pace of about $30 billion per month and to 
purchase agency mortgage-backed securities 
at a pace of about $25 billion per month.  
The Committee also directs the Desk to 
engage in dollar roll and coupon swap 
transactions 
as necessary 
to 
facilitate 
settlement of the Federal Reserve’s agency 
mortgage-backed 
securities 
transactions.  
The Committee directs the Desk to maintain 
its policy of rolling over maturing Treasury 
securities into new issues and its policy of 
reinvesting principal payments on all agency 
debt and agency mortgage-backed securities 
in agency mortgage-backed securities.  The 
System Open Market Account Manager and 
the Secretary will keep the Committee 
informed 
of 
ongoing 
developments 
regarding the System’s balance sheet that 
could affect the attainment over time of the 
Committee’s 
objectives 
of maximum 
employment and price stability.” 
The vote encompassed approval of the statement 
below to be released at 2:00 p.m.: 
“Information received since the Federal 
Open Market Committee met in January 
indicates that growth in economic activity 
slowed during the winter months, in part 
reflecting adverse weather conditions.  Labor 
market indicators were mixed but on balance 
showed 
further 
improvement. 
 The 
unemployment 
rate, however, 
remains 
elevated.  Household spending and business 
fixed investment continued to advance, while 
the recovery in the housing sector remained 
slow.  Fiscal policy is restraining economic 
growth, although the extent of restraint is 
diminishing.  Inflation has been running 
below the Committee’s longer-run objective, 
but longer-term inflation expectations have 
remained stable. 
Consistent with its statutory mandate, the 
Committee 
seeks 
to 
foster maximum 
employment and price stability. 
 The 
Committee expects that, with appropriate 
policy accommodation, economic activity 
will expand at a moderate pace and labor 

Minutes of the Meeting of March 18–19, 2014Page 9_____________________________________________________________________________________________market conditions will continue to improve 
gradually, moving 
toward 
those 
the 
Committee judges consistent with its dual 
mandate.  The Committee sees the risks to 
the outlook for the economy and the labor 
market as nearly balanced.  The Committee 
recognizes that inflation persistently below 
its 2 percent objective could pose risks to 
economic performance, and it is monitoring 
inflation developments carefully for evidence 
that inflation will move back toward its 
objective over the medium term. 
The Committee currently judges that there is 
sufficient underlying strength in the broader 
economy to support ongoing improvement 
in labor market conditions.  In light of the 
cumulative progress 
toward maximum 
employment and the improvement in the 
outlook for labor market conditions since the 
inception of the current asset purchase 
program, the Committee decided to make a 
further measured reduction in the pace of its 
asset purchases.  Beginning in April, the 
Committee will add to its holdings of agency 
mortgage-backed securities at a pace of     
$25 billion per month rather than $30 billion 
per month, and will add to its holdings of 
longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of 
$30 billion per month rather than $35 billion 
per month.  The Committee is maintaining 
its existing policy of reinvesting principal 
payments from its holdings of agency debt 
and agency mortgage-backed securities in 
agency mortgage-backed securities and of 
rolling over maturing Treasury securities at 
auction.  The Committee’s sizable and still-
increasing holdings of longer-term securities 
should maintain downward pressure on 
longer-term interest rates, support mortgage 
markets, and help to make broader financial 
conditions more accommodative, which in 
turn should promote a stronger economic 
recovery and help to ensure that inflation, 
over time, is at the rate most consistent with 
the Committee’s dual mandate. 
The Committee will 
closely monitor 
incoming 
information on economic and 
financial developments in coming months 
and will continue its purchases of Treasury 
and agency mortgage-backed securities, and 
employ its other policy tools as appropriate, 

until the outlook for the labor market has 
improved substantially in a context of price 
stability.  If incoming information broadly 
supports the Committee’s expectation of 
ongoing 
improvement 
in 
labor market 
conditions and inflation moving back toward 
its longer-run objective, the Committee will 
likely reduce the pace of asset purchases in 
further measured steps at future meetings.  
However, asset purchases are not on a preset 
course, and the Committee’s decisions about 
their pace will remain contingent on the 
Committee’s outlook for the labor market 
and inflation as well as its assessment of the 
likely efficacy and costs of such purchases. 
To support continued progress 
toward 
maximum employment and price stability, 
the Committee today reaffirmed its view that 
a highly accommodative stance of monetary 
policy remains appropriate.  In determining 
how long to maintain the current 0 to         
¼ percent target range for the federal funds 
rate, the Committee will assess progress—
both realized and expected—toward 
its 
objectives of maximum employment and 2 
percent inflation.  This assessment will take 
into account a wide range of information, 
including measures of 
labor market 
conditions, indicators of inflation pressures 
and inflation expectations, and readings on 
financial developments.  The Committee 
continues 
to anticipate, based on 
its 
assessment of these factors, that it likely will 
be appropriate to maintain the current target 
range for the federal funds rate for a 
considerable time after the asset purchase 
program 
ends, 
especially 
if projected 
inflation continues 
to 
run below 
the 
Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal, and 
provided 
that 
longer-term 
inflation 
expectations remain well anchored. 
When the Committee decides to begin to 
remove policy accommodation, it will take a 
balanced approach consistent with its longer-
run goals of maximum employment and 
inflation of 2 percent.  The Committee 
currently 
anticipates 
that, 
even 
after 
employment and inflation are near mandate-
consistent levels, economic conditions may, 
for some time, warrant keeping the target 
federal 
funds 
rate below 
levels 
the 

Page 10Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________Committee views as normal in the longer 
run. 
With 
the unemployment 
rate nearing         
6½ percent, the Committee has updated its 
forward guidance. 
 The change 
in the 
Committee’s guidance does not indicate any 
change in the Committee’s policy intentions 
as set forth in its recent statements.” 
Voting for this action:  Janet L. Yellen, William C. 
Dudley, Richard W. Fisher, Sandra Pianalto, Charles I. 
Plosser, Jerome H. Powell, Jeremy C. Stein, and Daniel 
K. Tarullo. 

Voting against this action:  Narayana Kocherlakota. 

Mr. Kocherlakota dissented because, in his view, the 
new forward guidance in the fifth paragraph of the 
statement would weaken the credibility of the Commit-
tee’s commitment to its inflation goal by failing to 
communicate purposeful steps to more rapidly increase 
inflation to the 2 percent target and by suggesting that 
the Committee views 
inflation persistently below          
2 percent as an acceptable outcome.  Moreover, he 
judged that the new guidance would act as a drag on 
economic activity because it provided little information 
about the desired rate of progress toward maximum 
employment and no quantitative measure of what con-
stitutes maximum employment, and thus would gener-
ate uncertainty about the extent to which the Commit-
tee is willing to use monetary stimulus to foster faster 
growth.  Mr. Kocherlakota strongly endorsed the sixth 
paragraph of the statement because providing infor-
mation about the Committee’s intentions for the feder-
al funds rate once employment and inflation are near 
mandate-consistent levels should help stimulate eco-
nomic activity by reducing uncertainty. 
It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee 
would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, April 29–30, 
2014.  The meeting adjourned at 10:05 a.m. on March 
19, 2014. 

Notation Vote 

By notation vote completed on February 18, 2014, the 
Committee unanimously approved the minutes of the 
Committee meeting held on January 28–29, 2014. 

Videoconference meeting of March 4 

The Committee met by videoconference on March 4, 
2014, to discuss issues associated with its forward guid-
ance for the federal funds rate.  The Committee dis-
cussed possible changes to its forward guidance that 
could provide additional information about the factors 
likely to enter its decisions regarding the federal funds 

rate target as the unemployment rate approached its 
6½ percent threshold and once that threshold was 
crossed.  The agenda did not contemplate any policy 
decisions, and none were taken. 
Many participants noted that market expectations of 
the future course of the federal funds rate were current-
ly reasonably well aligned with those of policymakers, 
and that a sizable change to the forward guidance could 
disturb this alignment.  Nonetheless, participants gen-
erally saw the Committee’s upcoming meeting as an 
opportune occasion for a reformulation of the guidance 
language; one of these participants suggested that the 
reformulation could be accompanied by a statement 
that the new language was intended to be consistent 
with current market expectations.  A few participants 
stressed that the Committee had several other vehicles, 
including the Chair’s postmeeting press conference, 
through which it could clarify its future policy inten-
tions. 
Participants agreed that the existing forward guidance, 
with its reference to a 6½ percent threshold for the 
unemployment rate, was becoming outdated as the un-
employment rate continued its expected gradual de-
cline.  Most participants felt that the quantitative 
thresholds had been very useful in communicating pol-
icy intentions when employment was far from man-
date-consistent levels, but, with the economy having 
moved appreciably closer to maximum employment, 
the forward guidance should emphasize that the Com-
mittee is focusing more on a broader set of economic 
indicators.  Thus, most participants felt that quantita-
tive thresholds, triggers, or floors should not be a part 
of future statement language, with a number of partici-
pants noting the uncertainty associated with defining 
and measuring the unemployment rate and the level of 
employment that would be most consistent with the 
Committee’s maximum employment objective, or other 
similar concepts.  These participants generally favored 
qualitative language describing the economic factors 
that would influence the Committee’s decision regard-
ing the first increase in the federal funds rate target.  
Participants put forward a number of suggestions for 
such qualitative language.  One participant favored 
linking the length of time that the federal funds rate 
would remain at the lower bound to the period over 
which complete recovery of the labor market was pro-
jected to occur, while another advocated qualitative 
forward guidance expressed in terms of the Commit-
tee’s projections of real output growth, arguing that 
such an approach would avoid the uncertainties associ-
ated with estimates of potential output or maximum 

Minutes of the Meeting of March 18–19, 2014Page 11_____________________________________________________________________________________________employment.  Yet another participant argued that it 
would be desirable for the statement to describe the 
Committee’s reasons for keeping the federal funds rate 
at the lower bound when standard policy rules were 
prescribing that the rate should be increased and noted 
that one possible reason for doing so is that the effec-
tive lower bound on the federal funds rate limits the 
Committee’s scope to provide accommodation in re-
sponse to adverse shocks.  In contrast, some partici-
pants expressed a preference for quantitative guidance.  
A few participants saw merit in stating explicitly that 
the Committee would provide accommodation to the 
extent necessary to prevent inflation from running per-
sistently below its 2 percent longer-run goal.  One of 
these participants argued that such forward guidance 
would strengthen the credibility of the Committee’s 
inflation objective as well as encourage employment 
outcomes that were most consistent with the Commit-
tee’s other objective of maximum employment.  An-
other participant suggested that the Committee state 
that it would adjust policy to keep projected inflation 
near 2 percent over the medium term, and that it would 
balance deviations from its objectives in the near term.  
Still another participant expressed a preference for stat-
ing explicit quantitative criteria for some labor market 
variable or variables. 
Most participants favored providing information about 

the likely behavior of the federal funds rate after its 
first increase.  A few participants, however, viewed the 
period of policy firming as likely to be far enough in 
the future that the Committee did not need to provide 
such information at this stage. 
Committee participants also considered whether re-
vised forward guidance should include a more promi-
nent mention of financial developments or of potential 
risks to financial stability.  Most participants felt that 
the Committee’s monitoring of financial conditions and 
of risks to financial stability was already well under-
stood by markets and that, while some reference to 
financial developments might usefully be included in 
the statement, a lengthy addition did not seem neces-
sary.  One participant favored including a reference in 
the statement to “financial conditions,” rather than 
“financial stability,” emphasizing that, when factors 
other than monetary policy induce a change in financial 
conditions, the Committee may need to take that 
change in financial conditions into account when mak-
ing its monetary policy decisions.

Summary of Economic Projections

In conjunction with the March 18–19, 2014, Federal 
Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, meeting 
participants—the 4 members of the Board of Gover-
nors and the 12 presidents of the Federal Reserve 
Banks, all of whom participated in the deliberations—
submitted their assessments of real output growth, the 
unemployment rate, inflation, and the target federal 
funds rate for each year from 2014 through 2016 and 
over the longer run.  Each participant’s assessment was 
based on information available at the time of the meet-
ing plus his or her judgment of appropriate monetary 
policy and assumptions about the factors likely to affect 
economic outcomes.  The longer-run projections rep-
resent each participant’s judgment of the value to 
which each variable would be expected to converge, 
over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in 
the absence of further shocks to the economy.  “Ap-
propriate monetary policy” is defined as the future path 
of policy that each participant deems most likely to 
foster outcomes for economic activity and inflation 
that best satisfy his or her individual interpretation of 
the Federal Reserve’s objectives of maximum employ-
ment and stable prices. 
Overall, FOMC participants expected that, under ap-
propriate monetary policy, economic growth would 
pick up this year and next, before moving down a bit 
but remaining above its longer-run rate in 2016, and 
that the unemployment rate would decline gradually 
toward its longer-run normal level over the projection 

period (table 1 and figure 1).  Almost all of the partici-
pants projected that inflation, as measured by the an-
nual change in the price index for personal consump-
tion expenditures (PCE), would rise steadily to a level 
at or slightly below the Committee’s 2 percent objective 
in 2016. 
Most participants expected that highly accommodative 
monetary policy would remain warranted over the next 
few years to foster progress toward the Federal Re-
serve’s longer-run objectives.  As shown in figure 2, all 
but one of the participants projected that it would be 
appropriate to wait until 2015 or later before beginning 
to increase the federal funds rate, and a large majority 
projected that it would then be appropriate to raise the 
target federal funds rate fairly gradually.  Almost all 
participants viewed appropriate policy as broadly con-
sistent with continued gradual slowing in the pace of 
the Committee’s purchases of longer-term securities 
and the completion of the program in the second half 
of this year. 
Most participants saw the uncertainty associated with 
their outlooks for economic growth and the unem-
ployment rate as similar to that of the past 20 years, 
and a majority saw the uncertainty associated with their 
projections for inflation as similar to that of the past  
20 years.  In addition, most participants considered the 
risks to the outlook for real gross domestic product 
(GDP), the unemployment rate, and inflation to be 
broadly balanced, although some saw the risks to their

    NOTE:  Projections of change in real gross domestic product (GDP) and projections for both measures of inflation are from the fourth quarter of the previous 
year to the fourth quarter of the year indicated.  PCE inflation and core PCE inflation are the percentage rates of change in, respectively, the price index for per-
sonal consumption expenditures (PCE) and the price index for PCE excluding food and energy.  Projections for the unemployment rate are for the average civil-
ian unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of the year indicated.  Each participant’s projections are based on his or her assessment of appropriate monetary
policy.  Longer-run projections represent each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge under appropriate mone-
tary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy.  The December projections were made in conjunction with the meeting of the Federal Open 
Market Committee on December 17–18, 2013. 
   1.  The central tendency excludes the three highest and three lowest projections for each variable in each year. 
   2.  The range for a variable in a given year includes all participants’ projections, from lowest to highest, for that variable in that year.

Note: In the upper panel, the height of each bar denotes the number of FOMC participants who judge that, under
appropriate monetary policy, the ﬁrst increase in the target federal funds rate from its current range of 0 to 1/4 percent
will occur in the speciﬁed calendar year. In December 2013, the numbers of FOMC participants who judged that the
ﬁrst increase in the target federal funds rate would occur in 2014, 2015, and 2016 were, respectively, 2, 12, and 3. In
the lower panel, each shaded circle indicates the value (rounded to the nearest 1/4 percentage point) of an individual
participant’s judgment of the appropriate level of the target federal funds rate at the end of the speciﬁed calendar year
or over the longer run.

Summary of Economic Projections of the Meeting of March 18–19, 2014Page 3_____________________________________________________________________________________________inflation forecasts as tilted to the downside. 

The Outlook for Economic Activity 

Participants generally projected that, conditional on 
their individual assumptions about appropriate mone-
tary policy, real GDP growth would pick up gradually 
this year and next to a pace somewhat exceeding their 
estimates of the longer-run normal rate of output 
growth.  Subsequently, in 2016, real GDP growth was 
projected to begin to move back toward its longer-run 
rate.  Most participants revised down a bit their projec-
tions of real GDP growth for 2014, compared with 
their projections in December 2013, and the top end of 
the central tendencies for output growth in each year 
and over the longer run moved down slightly.  None-
theless, participants pointed to a number of factors that 
they expected would contribute to a pickup in econom-
ic growth this year, such as an easing of the headwinds 
that have been weighing on growth, including dimin-
ished restraint from fiscal policy; rising household net 
worth and highly accommodative monetary policy also 
were expected to contribute.  In addition, many at-
tributed some of the softness in recent economic data 
to the transitory effects of unusually severe winter 
weather.  The central tendencies of participants’ projec-
tions for real GDP growth were 2.8 to 3.0 percent in 
2014, 3.0 to 3.2 percent in 2015, and 2.5 to 3.0 percent 
in 2016.  The central tendency for the longer-run nor-
mal rate of growth of real GDP was 2.2 to 2.3 percent. 
Participants anticipated a gradual decline in the unem-
ployment rate over the projection period.  The central 
tendencies of participants’ forecasts for the unemploy-
ment rate in the fourth quarter of each year were 6.1 to 
6.3 percent in 2014, 5.6 to 5.9 percent in 2015, and    
5.2 to 5.6 percent in 2016.  Nearly all participants re-
vised down their projected paths for the unemploy-
ment rate relative to their December projections, with 
some pointing to the decline in the unemployment rate 
in recent months.  The central tendency of participants’ 
estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemploy-
ment that would prevail under appropriate monetary 
policy and in the absence of further shocks to the 
economy also moved lower, to 5.2 to 5.6 percent.  A 
majority of participants projected that the unemploy-
ment rate would be close to their individual estimates 
of its longer-run level at the end of 2016. 
Figures 3.A and 3.B show that participants continued 
to hold a range of views regarding the likely outcomes 
for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate over 
the next two years.  The diversity of views reflected 
their individual assessments of the rate at which the 
headwinds that have been holding back the pace of the 

economic recovery would abate, the anticipated path 
for foreign economic activity, the trajectory for growth 
in household net worth, and the appropriate path of 
monetary policy.  Relative to December, the disper-
sions of participants’ projections for real GDP growth 
and the unemployment rate over the period from 2014 
to 2016 narrowed slightly. 

The Outlook for Inflation 

Participants’ views on the broad outlook for inflation 
under the assumption of appropriate monetary policy 
were nearly unchanged, on balance, from those in their 
December projections. All participants anticipated that, 
on average, both headline and core inflation would rise 
gradually over the next few years, and a large majority 
of participants expected headline inflation to be at or 
slightly below the Committee’s 2 percent objective in 
2016.  Specifically, the central tendencies for PCE infla-
tion were 1.5 to 1.6 percent in 2014, 1.5 to 2.0 percent 
in 2015, and 1.7 to 2.0 percent in 2016.  The central 
tendencies of the forecasts for core inflation were 
broadly similar to those for the headline measure.  A 
number of participants viewed the combination of sta-
ble inflation expectations and steadily diminishing re-
source slack as likely to contribute to a gradual rise of 
inflation back toward the Committee’s longer-run ob-
jective. 
Figures 3.C and 3.D provide information on the diver-
sity of participants’ views about the outlook for infla-
tion.  The ranges of participants’ projections for overall 
inflation were little changed relative to December.  The 
forecasts for PCE inflation in 2016 were at or below 
the Committee’s longer-run objective.  Similar to the 
projections for headline inflation, the projections for 
core inflation in 2016 were also concentrated near        
2 percent. 

Appropriate Monetary Policy 

As indicated in figure 2, most participants judged that 
very low levels of the federal funds rate would remain 
appropriate for the next few years.  In particular,        
13 participants thought that the first increase in the 
target federal funds rate would not be warranted until 
sometime in 2015, and two judged that policy firming 
would likely not be appropriate until 2016.  Only one 
participant thought that an increase in the federal funds 
rate would be appropriate in 2014. 
All participants but one projected that the unemploy-
ment rate would be below 6 percent at the end of the 
year in which they currently anticipate that it will be-
come appropriate to raise the federal funds rate above 
its effective lower bound.  Moreover, all but one pro-

tee’s longer-run objective at that time.  Most partici-
pants projected that the unemployment rate would re-
main above their estimates of its longer-run normal 
level at the end of the year in which they saw the feder-
al funds rate increasing from its effective lower bound. 
Figure 3.E provides the distribution of participants’ 
judgments regarding the appropriate level of the target 
federal funds rate at the end of each calendar year from 
2014 to 2016 and over the longer run.  As noted earlier, 
almost all participants judged that economic conditions 
would warrant maintaining the current exceptionally 
low level of the federal funds rate until 2015.  The me-
dian value of the rate at the end of 2015 and 2016 in-
creased 25 and 50 basis points, respectively, since De-
cember, while the mean values increased 7 and 25 basis 
points, respectively.  The dispersion of projections for 
the value of the federal funds rate in each year nar-
rowed slightly.  Almost all participants expected that 
the federal funds rate at the end of 2016 would still be 
below their individual assessments of its longer-run 
level, with many pointing to subdued inflation pres-
sures, below-mandate inflation, the still-noticeable ef-
fects of headwinds, or the need to maintain low rates to 
support the recovery as reasons to keep the federal 
funds rate low at that time.  Estimates of the longer-
run target for the federal funds rate ranged from 3½ to 
about 4¼ percent, reflecting the Committee’s inflation 
objective of 2 percent and participants’ individual 
judgments about the appropriate longer-run level of the 
real federal funds rate in the absence of further shocks 
to the economy. 
Participants also described their views regarding the 
appropriate path of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.  
Conditional on their respective economic outlooks, 
almost all participants judged that it would be appro-
priate to continue to reduce the pace of the Commit-
tee’s purchases of longer-term securities in measured 
steps and to conclude purchases in the second half of 
this year.  Two participants projected a more rapid re-
duction in the pace of purchases and an earlier end to 
the asset purchase program. 
Participants’ views of the appropriate path for mone-
tary policy were informed by their judgments about the 
state of the economy, including the values of the un-
employment rate and other labor market indicators that 
would be consistent with maximum employment, the 
extent to which the economy was currently falling short 
of maximum employment, the prospects for inflation 
to reach the Committee’s longer-term objective of 2 
percent, and the balance of risks around the outlook.  

A couple of participants also mentioned using various 
monetary policy rules to guide their thinking on the 
appropriate path for the federal funds rate. 

Uncertainty and Risks 

Nearly all participants continued to judge the levels of 
uncertainty about their projections for real GDP 
growth and the unemployment rate as broadly similar 
to the norm during the previous 20 years (figure 4).1  
As in December, most participants continued to judge 
the risks to real GDP growth and the unemployment 
rate to be broadly balanced.  Two participants viewed 
risks to output growth as weighted to the downside, 
reflecting their concerns about possible geopolitical 
developments and the strength of external demand.

NOTE:  Error ranges shown are measured as plus or minus the root 
mean squared error of projections for 1994 through 2013 that were 
released in the spring by various private and government forecasters.  As 
described in the box “Forecast Uncertainty,” under certain assumptions, 
there is about a 70 percent probability that actual outcomes for real 
GDP, unemployment, and consumer prices will be in ranges implied by 
the average size of projection errors made in the past.  For more infor-
mation, see David Reifschneider and Peter Tulip (2007), “Gauging the 
Uncertainty of the Economic Outlook from Historical Forecasting Er-

Summary of Economic Projections of the Meeting of March 18–19, 2014Page 11_____________________________________________________________________________________________Almost all participants saw the level of uncertainty and 
the balance of risks around their forecasts for overall 
PCE inflation and core inflation as little changed from 
December.  The majority of participants continued to 
judge the levels of uncertainty associated with their 
forecasts for the two inflation measures to be broadly 
similar to historical norms and the risks to those pro-
jections to be broadly balanced.  Five participants, 

however, saw the risks to their inflation forecasts as 
tilted to the downside, reflecting, for example, the pos-
sibility that the current low levels of inflation could 
prove more persistent than anticipated as well as ele-
vated global risks to the outlook.  Conversely, one par-
ticipant cited upside risks to inflation stemming from 
uncertainty about the timing and efficacy of the Com-
mittee’s withdrawal of accommodation.

Forecast Uncertainty 

The economic projections provided by 
the members of the Board of Governors and 
the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks 
inform discussions of monetary policy among 
policymakers and can aid public understand-
ing of the basis for policy actions.  Consider-
able uncertainty attends these projections, 
however.  The economic and statistical models 
and relationships used to help produce eco-
nomic forecasts are necessarily imperfect de-
scriptions of the real world, and the future 
path of the economy can be affected by myr-
iad unforeseen developments and events.  
Thus, in setting the stance of monetary policy, 
participants consider not only what appears to 
be the most likely economic outcome as em-
bodied in their projections, but also the range 
of alternative possibilities, the likelihood of 
their occurring, and the potential costs to the 
economy should they occur. 
Table 2 summarizes the average historical 
accuracy of a range of forecasts, including 
those reported in past Monetary Policy Reports 
and those prepared by the Federal Reserve 
Board’s staff in advance of meetings of the 
Federal Open Market Committee.  The pro-
jection error ranges shown in the table il-
lustrate the considerable uncertainty associat-
ed with economic forecasts.  For example, 
suppose a participant projects that real gross 
domestic product (GDP) and total consumer 
prices will rise steadily at annual rates of, re-
spectively, 3 percent and 2 percent.  If the 
uncertainty attending those projections is simi-
lar to that experienced in the past and the risks 
around the projections are broadly balanced, 
the numbers reported in table 2 would imply a 
probability of about 70 percent that actual 
GDP would expand within a range of 1.4 to 
4.6   percent   in   the   current   year,   0.9   to 

5.1 percent in the second year, and 1.0 to     
5.0 percent in the third year.  The correspond-
ing 70 percent confidence intervals for overall 
inflation would be 1.1 to 2.9 percent in the cur-
rent year, 1.0 to 3.0 percent in the second year, 
and 0.9 to 3.1 percent in the third year. 
Because current conditions may differ 
from those that prevailed, on average, over his-
tory, participants provide judgments as to 
whether the uncertainty attached to their pro-
jections of each variable is greater than, smaller 
than, or broadly similar to typical levels of 
forecast uncertainty in the past, as shown in 
table 2.  Participants also provide judgments as 
to whether the risks to their projections are 
weighted to the upside, are weighted to the 
downside, or are broadly balanced.  That is, 
participants judge whether each variable is 
more likely to be above or below their projec-
tions of the most likely outcome.  These judg-
ments about the uncertainty and the risks at-
tending each participant’s projections are dis-
tinct from the diversity of participants’ views 
about the most likely outcomes.  Forecast un-
certainty is concerned with the risks associated 
with a particular projection rather than with 
divergences across a number of different pro-
jections. 
As with real activity and inflation, the out-
look for the future path of the federal funds 
rate is subject to considerable uncertainty.  This 
uncertainty arises primarily because each partic-
ipant’s assessment of the appropriate stance of 
monetary policy depends importantly on the 
evolution of real activity and inflation over 
time.  If economic conditions evolve in an un-
expected manner, then assessments of the ap-
propriate setting of the federal funds rate 
would change from that point forward.
