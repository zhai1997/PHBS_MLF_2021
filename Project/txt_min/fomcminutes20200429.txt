Developments in Financial Markets and Open Mar-
ket Operations 

The System Open Market Account (SOMA) manager 
first discussed developments in financial markets.  Fi-
nancial conditions had shown notable improvement 

over recent weeks.  Equity price indexes were up sub-
stantially from the lows of late March, safe-haven de-
mands for the dollar had receded, and measures of real-
ized and implied volatility across markets had dimin-
ished.  Market participants pointed to swift and forceful 
actions taken by the Federal Reserve, coupled with 
strong fiscal measures, and some indications of a slowing 
in the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19) in major 
economies as factors contributing to these develop-
ments. 
That said, market participants remained very uncertain 
about the economic outlook, and contacts highlighted 
an array of remaining risks, including those in corporate 
credit markets, emerging markets, and mortgage mar-
kets.  In corporate credit markets, concerns about po-
tential defaults were rising, and ratings agencies had put 
on negative watch or downgraded many issuers.  In 
emerging markets, the steep decline in commodity prices 
was exacerbating financial pressures for some emerging 
market economies (EMEs), which were also facing 
strains arising from capital outflows and a reduction in 
trade activity.  And in mortgage markets, the likely in-
crease in mortgage delinquencies associated with for-
bearance polices and an eventual rise in defaults were 
sources of concern for bank and nonbank lenders. 
Open Market Desk surveys suggested that market par-
ticipants anticipated a sharp near-term decline in eco-
nomic activity, followed by some recovery later this year.  
Against this backdrop, market participants generally ex-
pected the target range for the federal funds rate to re-
main at the effective lower bound for the next couple of 
years.  Respondents to Desk surveys attached almost no 
probability to the FOMC implementing negative policy 
rates.  Some survey respondents indicated that they ex-
pected modifications to the Committee’s forward guid-
ance, but not at the current meeting. 
The manager then reviewed recent open market opera-
tions.  Since mid-March, at the direction of the FOMC, 
the Desk had purchased very large quantities of Treasury 
and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) in order 
to support the smooth functioning of these critical mar-
kets.  The Desk evaluated a broad array of indicators to 
assess market functioning.  These indicators suggested 
considerable improvement in market functioning, and 
the Desk gradually scaled back the pace of purchases ac-
cordingly.  Market participants anticipated that the pace 
of purchases would slow after the June meeting, but they 
expected that outright securities holdings in the SOMA 
portfolio would continue to expand at least through the 
end of the year.  The SOMA manager expected that, if 

Page 2Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
conditions continued to improve, the pace of purchases 
could be reduced somewhat further; however, consistent 
with the directive, the Desk was prepared to increase 
purchases as needed should market functioning worsen. 
Conditions in money markets had improved over recent 
weeks.  The intense strains across a range of short-term 
funding markets that emerged in March had subsided.  
The expansion of Federal Reserve repurchase agreement 
(repo) operations, the enhancement and expansion of 
funding available through the discount window and 
swap lines, and the funding provided through the Pri-
mary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF), the Money Market 
Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (MMLF), and the Com-
mercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF) were likely im-
portant in relieving pressures across a range of short-
term funding markets.  The manager noted that, despite 
these improvements, rates in some term funding mar-
kets remained elevated, although forward measures sug-
gested the upward pressure on these rates might ease in 
coming weeks.  With conditions in short-term funding 
markets having improved substantially and with repo 
operations no longer needed to maintain ample reserve 
levels, the manager noted that it might be appropriate to 
position the Federal Reserve’s repurchase operations in 
a backstop role.  For example, the minimum bid rate in 
repo operations could be increased somewhat relative to 
the level of the interest rate on excess reserves (the 
IOER rate). 
Later in the intermeeting period, short-term interest 
rates drifted lower and settled at near-zero levels.  Al-
though rates appeared stable, the manager suggested that 
circumstances could arise in which temporarily raising 
the per-counterparty limit on the overnight reverse repo 
operation would support policy implementation.  The 
manager also noted that some market participants antic-
ipated that the Federal Reserve might increase the IOER 
rate in order to move the federal funds rate closer to the 
middle of the target range and to address market func-
tioning issues that could arise over time with overnight 
rates at very low levels.  However, there appeared to be 
limited risk that the federal funds rate would move be-
low the target range, as the Federal Home Loan Banks—
the dominant lenders in the federal funds market—can 
earn a zero rate on balances maintained in their account 
at the Federal Reserve.  Moreover, there were few signs 
to date that the low level of overnight funding rates had 
adversely affected market functioning, and trading vol-
umes remained robust.  The SOMA manager noted that 
the staff would continue to monitor developments. 

The Committee voted unanimously to renew the recip-
rocal currency arrangements with the Bank of Canada 
and the Bank of Mexico; these arrangements are associ-
ated with the Federal Reserve’s participation in the 
North American Framework Agreement of 1994.  In ad-
dition, the Committee voted unanimously to renew the 
dollar and foreign currency liquidity swap arrangements 
with the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the Bank 
of Japan, the European Central Bank, and the Swiss Na-
tional Bank.  The votes to renew the Federal Reserve’s 
participation in these standing arrangements occur an-
nually at the April or May FOMC meeting. 
By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s 
domestic transactions over the intermeeting period.  
There were no intervention operations in foreign curren-
cies for the System’s account during the intermeeting pe-
riod. 

Staff Review of the Economic Situation 

The coronavirus outbreak and the measures taken to 
protect public health were severely disrupting economic 
activity in the United States and abroad.  The available 
information for the April 28–29 meeting indicated that 
U.S. labor market conditions deteriorated substantially 
in March and April, and real gross domestic product 
(GDP) declined sharply in the first quarter of the year.  
In addition, a variety of economic indicators were al-
ready pointing toward an extraordinary contraction in 
GDP in the second quarter.  Consumer price inflation, 
as measured by the 12-month percentage change in the 
price index for personal consumption expenditures 
(PCE), remained below 2 percent in February. 
Job losses surged in March, even though the drop in to-
tal nonfarm payroll employment reflected only those 
changes that had occurred through the mid-month ref-
erence period of the establishment survey.  In addition, 
the unemployment rate jumped to 4.4 percent in March, 
and the labor force participation rate decreased notably.  
After economic shutdowns started to occur on a wide-
spread basis, initial claims for unemployment insurance 
benefits skyrocketed in the second half of March 
through the first half of April, a development that 
pointed to substantial job losses in April.  Nominal wage 
growth remained moderate, as average hourly earnings 
for all employees increased 3.1 percent over the 
12 months ending in March. 
Total PCE price inflation and core PCE price inflation, 
which excludes consumer food and energy prices, both 
increased 1.8 percent over the 12 months ending in Feb-
ruary.  The trimmed mean measure of 12-month PCE 
price inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank 

_____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of April 28–29, 2020Page 3 
of Dallas was 2.0 percent in February.  The consumer 
price index (CPI) rose 1.5 percent over the 12 months 
ending in March, and the core CPI increased 2.1 percent 
over the same period.  The total CPI rose less than the 
core CPI mostly because of substantial declines in con-
sumer energy prices, which were reflecting significantly 
lower crude oil prices.  Recent readings on survey-based 
measures of longer-run inflation expectations were little 
changed on balance.  The University of Michigan Sur-
veys of Consumers measure for the next 5 to 10 years 
edged up in April, and the 3-year-ahead measure from 
the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Survey of Con-
sumer Expectations edged down in March; both 
measures remained in their recent ranges. 
Real PCE declined steeply in the first quarter of the year.  
The components of the nominal retail sales data used to 
estimate PCE, along with the sales of light motor vehi-
cles, fell substantially in March, reflecting the effects of 
the widespread economic shutdowns.  Moreover, the 
consumer sentiment measures from both the Michigan 
and the Conference Board surveys deteriorated substan-
tially over March and April.  Real disposable personal 
income was about flat in the first quarter, so the personal 
saving rate moved up notably with the decline in spend-
ing. 
In contrast to other sectors of the economy, real resi-
dential investment expanded strongly in the first quarter 
as a whole, although housing-sector activity had started 
to slow dramatically late in the quarter.  Starts and build-
ing permit issuance for single-family homes, along with 
starts of multifamily units, tumbled in March.  In addi-
tion, sales of both new and existing homes contracted 
sharply in March, and survey measures of builders’ sen-
timent plunged in April. 
Real business fixed investment slumped in the first quar-
ter following moderate declines over the previous three 
quarters.  Spending for business equipment fell consid-
erably in the first quarter, led by a sharp decrease in pur-
chases of transportation equipment.  Business invest-
ment in nonresidential structures also dropped notably.  
The coronavirus outbreak and the effects on economic 
activity of measures to contain it, together with the as-
sociated elevated level of uncertainty, were likely re-
flected in recent downbeat readings on business senti-
ment in national and regional surveys and appeared to 
weigh heavily on business investment.  In addition, the 
effects of substantial further declines in crude oil prices 
were being seen in the falling number of crude oil and 

natural gas rigs in operation through late April, an indi-
cator of business spending on structures in the drilling 
and mining sector. 
Total industrial production fell precipitously in March, 
as the coronavirus outbreak led many factories to close 
late in the month.  The decline in manufacturing output 
was led by a pullback in the production of motor vehi-
cles and related parts.  Output in the mining sector—
which includes crude oil extraction—also decreased sig-
nificantly in the wake of the recent declines in crude oil 
prices. 
Total real government purchases only edged up in the 
first quarter, led by a modest increase in federal pur-
chases.  State and local purchases were about flat, reflect-
ing the effects of public school closures beginning in 
mid-March. 
Real exports declined sharply in the first quarter.  How-
ever, imports declined at a much faster rate so that net 
exports made a sizable positive contribution to GDP 
growth.  Much of the quarterly decline in trade volumes 
reflected a sharp drop in March due to weak demand 
globally and disruptions related to the coronavirus out-
break.  The fall in exports was concentrated in services, 
particularly those parts of the sector held down by travel 
restrictions. 
Foreign economic activity fell sharply in the first quarter 
of the year amid widespread mandatory business shut-
downs and strict social-distancing measures to contain 
the spread of the coronavirus outbreak.  In China, where 
lockdowns were first implemented, real GDP contracted 
sharply in the first quarter, and Canada, Korea, and Sin-
gapore also saw substantial declines.  Monthly indicators 
suggested that activity also plummeted in March and 
April in many other economies, particularly in the euro 
area and the United Kingdom, which both saw purchas-
ing managers indexes fall to record-low levels.  Many 
foreign governments announced large fiscal packages to 
address the sudden loss of income by firms and house-
holds.  Many foreign central banks cut policy rates, initi-
ated or enhanced credit facilities, relaxed capital require-
ments for financial institutions, and ramped up asset 
purchase programs to alleviate liquidity concerns in for-
eign capital markets.  Foreign inflation fell steeply, re-
flecting large drops in energy prices related to plunging 
oil prices, while core inflation pressures generally re-
mained muted.

Staff Review of the Financial Situation 

In the middle part of March, financial markets experi-
enced record declines in the prices of risky assets, wide-
spread illiquidity, and elevated volatility, as uncertainty 
regarding the effects of the coronavirus outbreak on the 
global economy jumped.  However, following the an-
nouncement and subsequent launching of a number of 
Federal Reserve emergency liquidity programs, the pas-
sage of the Cares Act (Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Eco-
nomic Security Act), and early signs of a decline in out-
break intensity in the United States and many major for-
eign economies, the extreme volatility and illiquidity sub-
sided and prices of most risky assets increased notably.  
Over the intermeeting period, on net, the S&P 500 index 
rose, option-implied volatility fell, and Treasury yields 
declined, while corporate bond spreads widened some-
what.  Financing conditions for businesses, households, 
and state and local governments were strained over the 
intermeeting period.  However, the Federal Reserve’s 
announcements and start-ups of emergency liquidity fa-
cilities appeared to improve conditions in many of these 
markets.  These facilities were established with the ap-
proval of the Secretary of the Treasury under the author-
ity of section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act and were 
designed to support the flow of credit to businesses, 
households, and state and local governments. 
Treasury markets experienced extreme volatility in mid-
March, and market liquidity became substantially im-
paired as investors sold large volumes of medium- and 
long-term Treasury securities.  Following a period of ex-
traordinarily rapid purchases of Treasury securities and 
agency MBS by the Federal Reserve, Treasury market li-
quidity gradually improved through the remainder of the 
intermeeting period, and Treasury yields became less 
volatile.  Although market depth remained exceptionally 
low and bid-ask spreads for off-the-run securities and 
long-term on-the-run securities remained elevated, bid-
ask spreads for short-term on-the-run securities fell 
close to levels seen earlier in the year.  Yields on nominal 
Treasury securities declined across the maturity spec-
trum, with the 10- and 30-year yields ending the period 
near all-time lows.  A straight read of market quotes sug-
gested that the expected federal funds rate would remain 
under 25 basis points through 2022.  Measures of infla-
tion compensation based on Treasury Inflation-
Protected Securities (TIPS) ended the period higher, on 
net, but were still low by historical standards.  Inflation 
compensation fell sharply in the first half of March but 
subsequently recovered, as overall financial conditions 
and TIPS liquidity improved.  The market for agency 
MBS also experienced substantial stresses in mid-March, 

and agency MBS spreads to Treasury yields widened and 
were volatile.  However, market conditions for agency 
MBS improved significantly in the second half of March, 
supported by the Federal Reserve’s additional purchases 
of these securities. 
Stock price indexes were exceptionally volatile early in 
the intermeeting period, and one-month option-implied 
volatility on the S&P 500 index reached a record high.  
Equity market volatility moved down substantially over 
the remainder of the intermeeting period but remained 
elevated, and equity prices more than retraced their ear-
lier declines to end the intermeeting period notably 
higher.  Broad stock price index increases over the inter-
meeting period were led by the energy, consumer discre-
tionary, basic materials, and health-care sectors.  Broad 
equity price indexes remained, however, markedly below 
peaks registered earlier this year.  Corporate bond 
spreads over comparable-maturity Treasury yields wid-
ened sharply in the beginning of the intermeeting period, 
and they subsequently retraced most of their increases to 
end up only somewhat higher on net.  Corporate bond 
spreads at the end of the intermeeting period still stood 
significantly above their levels in January. 
In short-term funding markets, strains intensified in 
mid-March.  Spreads of yields of term money market in-
struments over comparable-maturity overnight index 
swap rates increased sharply, and issuance of unsecured 
commercial paper, negotiable certificates of deposit, and 
short-term municipal debt declined substantially and 
shifted to very short maturities.  Institutional prime 
money market funds (MMFs) experienced heavy re-
demptions and reportedly faced difficulties selling assets 
amid impaired secondary-market liquidity.  The an-
nouncements and start-ups of several Federal Reserve 
emergency liquidity facilities in the second half of March 
helped stabilize short-term funding markets, and, by the 
end of the intermeeting period, spreads had narrowed 
across the board.  Repo rates were elevated in mid-
March but normalized following the very large inflows 
of funds into government MMFs, the expansion of the 
Federal Reserve’s repo operations, and the announce-
ment of the PDCF.  The effective federal funds rate was 
at the top of the target range for a few days following 
the March FOMC meeting and, after declining in the 
second half of March, stayed at around 5 basis points for 
most of April. 
Early in the period, cascading shutdowns in many coun-
tries weighed heavily on risk sentiment abroad.  Many 
foreign financial markets experienced severe illiquidity 
and substantial volatility, and foreign equity indexes 

_____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of April 28–29, 2020Page 5 
posted large declines.  However, extraordinary monetary 
and fiscal policy actions in the United States and abroad 
helped improve market sentiment, and most major for-
eign equity indexes subsequently rebounded notably.  
That said, compared with early this year, foreign equity 
indexes stayed sharply lower, and option-implied equity 
volatility abroad remained elevated.  Advanced-econ-
omy sovereign yields were also volatile, but most sover-
eign yields ended the period somewhat lower.  By the 
end of the intermeeting period, policy rates in most ma-
jor advanced foreign economies (AFEs) were at or near 
their effective lower bounds.  In mid-March, Emerging 
Market Bond Index (EMBI) spreads widened sharply, 
and capital outflows from EMEs reached record levels.  
As global sentiment improved somewhat, those capital 
outflows slowed and EMBI spreads partially retraced 
earlier increases. 
Strong demand for dollars amid flight to safety globally, 
together with disruptions in U.S. short-term funding 
markets, caused severe strains in funding markets for 
dollars abroad, especially early in the intermeeting pe-
riod.  The premiums paid by investors to borrow dollars 
using the foreign exchange swap market over the costs 
of directly borrowing dollars widened sharply as the end 
of the first quarter approached.  FOMC actions, includ-
ing several changes to the standing central bank liquidity 
swap lines and a temporary expansion in the number of 
central bank counterparties, as well as the announce-
ment of the FIMA (Foreign and International Monetary 
Authorities) Repo Facility, notably improved conditions 
in the foreign exchange swap market.  Nonetheless, con-
ditions in this market remained strained. 
Over the period, the staff’s broad dollar index increased, 
with the dollar appreciating modestly against AFE cur-
rencies and notably against EME currencies.  Currencies 
of vulnerable commodity exporters, such as Mexico and 
Brazil, depreciated sharply.  At the end of the intermeet-
ing period, the broad dollar index remained significantly 
higher than at the beginning of the year. 
Financing conditions for nonfinancial businesses were 
strained in March, particularly for lower-rated firms and 
small businesses.  Federal Reserve announcements of fa-
cilities to support the flow of credit to businesses, house-
holds, and state and local governments appeared to im-
prove financing conditions in many markets, although 
conditions had yet to normalize.  Issuance of specula-
tive-grade bonds and leveraged loans was extremely low 
in March but resumed, at a slow pace, in April.  Invest-
ment-grade issuance, while relatively slow in early 

March, was robust following the Federal Reserve’s an-
nouncements in late March of the Primary Market Cor-
porate Credit Facility and the Secondary Market Corpo-
rate Credit Facility.  Conditions in the market for corpo-
rate bonds and loans improved further in response to 
the Federal Reserve’s announcement in April that it 
would expand these facilities to include firms that had 
been recently downgraded to just below investment-
grade status. 
Commercial and industrial (C&I) lending conditions 
were somewhat tight.  Although C&I loans increased 
strongly, this increase was largely driven by firms draw-
ing down existing lines of credit; they reportedly did so 
to shore up liquidity for precautionary motives and to 
meet funding needs.  In the April Senior Loan Officer 
Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS), 
banks reported having tightened their C&I lending 
standards and terms for firms of all sizes.  Credit quality 
and the earnings outlook of nonfinancial corporations 
deteriorated substantially, and market analysts forecast a 
large volume of downgrades of nonfinancial corporate 
bonds, including a substantial volume from triple-B to 
speculative grade.  Credit conditions for small businesses 
were tight.  Concerns about the finances of state and lo-
cal governments contributed to a marked deterioration 
in credit conditions in the municipal bond market in 
March.  Although strains lessened amid Federal Reserve 
announcements on emergency lending facilities to sup-
port the flow of credit and liquidity to state and local 
governments—specifically, expansions to the MMLF 
and the CPFF and the establishment of the Municipal 
Liquidity Facility—spreads remained high and issuance 
subdued at the end of the intermeeting period. 
Financing conditions for commercial real estate (CRE) 
were strained.  Non-agency commercial mortgage-
backed securities (CMBS) issuance shut down, although 
secondary-market spreads narrowed following the ex-
tension of the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facil-
ity (TALF) to include non-agency CMBS as eligible col-
lateral.  Meanwhile, agency CMBS issuance continued, 
supported by the Federal Reserve’s purchases of these 
securities.  Most April SLOOS respondents reported 
having tightened lending standards for CRE loans.  CRE 
loans on banks’ books increased in the second half of 
March, in part because banks were unable to securitize 
some nonresidential loans. 
Financing conditions in residential mortgage markets 
were tight for low-rated borrowers and other borrowers 
who rely on nonconforming mortgages.  Many mortgage 
originators and warehouse lenders announced tighter 

Page 6Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ 
underwriting standards on new originations.  Despite a 
considerable widening of the spread between the pri-
mary mortgage rate and MBS yields, primary mortgage 
interest rates were low by historical standards, and avail-
able indicators suggested that refinancing activity re-
mained elevated.  The volume of mortgage rate locks for 
home-purchase loans dropped materially in early April, 
reflecting in part declines in homebuyer demand and dis-
ruptions in the home search and purchase process. 
Financing conditions in consumer credit markets tight-
ened somewhat on net.  Spreads on consumer asset-
backed securities jumped in mid-March, and primary-
market issuance came to a halt.  However, in response 
to the announcement of the TALF and to diminished 
broader financial market uncertainty, spreads retraced 
most of their increase in the early part of the period, and 
primary-market issuance resumed.  Though banks in the 
April SLOOS reported tightening standards on new 
consumer loans, respondents also experienced weaker 
demand for all consumer loan types.  Auto loan interest 
rates dropped sharply in early April as manufacturers in-
troduced attractive financing programs to boost sales. 
The staff assessed the stability of the financial system 
during the coronavirus outbreak.  The banking sector, 
including the large banks, was resilient coming into this 
period.  Banks were able to meet surging demand for 
draws on credit lines while also building loan loss re-
serves to absorb higher expected defaults.  In other parts 
of the financial system, however, some notable vulnera-
bilities that had been identified in previous financial sta-
bility assessments exacerbated financial strains.  In 
March, institutional prime MMFs and other institutions 
relying on unstable funding sources faced significant 
stress, a situation that put in jeopardy the orderly func-
tioning of some financial markets.  Federal Reserve ac-
tions to enhance the liquidity and functioning of key 
markets reduced these stresses notably.  Open-end mu-
tual funds that invest in corporate bonds and loans—
institutions that typically face a timing mismatch be-
tween investors’ ability to redeem shares and the funds’ 
ability to sell assets—experienced heavy outflows and li-
quidity strains in mid-March.  Redemptions later eased, 
however, amid the general improvement in financial 
markets.  Business debt, which appeared to be high com-
pared with fundamentals before the coronavirus out-
break, seemed poised to rise further as businesses bor-
rowed to maintain their capacity to restart operations.  
Values of CRE faced the risk of large declines in re-
sponse to the coronavirus outbreak, although updated 
readings were not yet available.  The staff provided a pre-
liminary reading on potential emerging risks to financial 

stability in the aftermath of the coronavirus outbreak.  
This reading highlighted possible vulnerabilities in mort-
gage servicers, insurance companies, and large, highly 
leveraged financial intermediaries. 

Staff Economic Outlook 

The projection for the U.S. economy prepared by the 
staff for the April FOMC meeting was downgraded no-
tably from the March meeting forecast in response to 
information on the spread of the coronavirus and the 
measures undertaken to contain it both at home and 
abroad.  U.S. real GDP was forecast to plummet and the 
unemployment rate to soar in the second quarter of this 
year.  The substantial fiscal policy measures and mone-
tary policy support that had been put in place were ex-
pected to help mitigate the deterioration in economic 
conditions and help boost the recovery. 
The staff noted that, importantly, the future perfor-
mance of the economy would depend on the evolution 
of the coronavirus outbreak and the measures under-
taken to contain it.  Under the staff’s baseline assump-
tions that the current restrictions on social interactions 
and business operations would ease gradually this year, 
real GDP was forecast to rise appreciably and the unem-
ployment rate to decline considerably in the second half 
of the year, although a complete recovery was not ex-
pected by year-end.  Inflation was projected to weaken 
this year, reflecting both the deterioration in resource 
utilization and sizable expected declines in consumer en-
ergy prices.  Under the baseline assumptions, economic 
conditions were projected to continue to improve, and 
inflation to pick back up, over the next two years. 
The staff observed that uncertainty regarding the eco-
nomic effects of the coronavirus outbreak was extremely 
elevated and that the historical behavior of the 
U.S. economy in response to past economic shocks pro-
vided limited guidance for making judgments about how 
the economy might evolve over coming quarters.  In 
light of the significant uncertainty and downside risks as-
sociated with the evolution of the coronavirus outbreak, 
how much the economy would weaken, and how long it 
would take to recover, the staff judged that a more pes-
simistic projection was no less plausible than the baseline 
forecast.  In this scenario, a second wave of the corona-
virus outbreak, with another round of strict restrictions 
on social interactions and business operations, was as-
sumed to begin around year-end, inducing a decrease in 
real GDP, a jump in the unemployment rate, and re-
newed downward pressure on inflation next year.  Com-
pared with the baseline, the disruption to economic ac-
tivity was more severe and protracted in this scenario,

with real GDP and inflation lower and the unemploy-
ment rate higher by the end of the medium-term projec-
tion. 

Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the 
Economic Outlook 

Participants noted that the coronavirus outbreak was 
causing tremendous human and economic hardship 
across the United States and around the world.  The vi-
rus and the measures taken to protect public health were 
inducing sharp declines in economic activity and a surge 
in job losses.  Weaker demand and significantly lower oil 
prices were holding down consumer price inflation.  The 
disruptions to economic activity here and abroad had 
significantly affected financial conditions and had im-
paired the flow of credit to U.S. households and busi-
nesses. 
Participants judged that the effects of the coronavirus 
outbreak and the ongoing public health crisis would con-
tinue to weigh heavily on economic activity, employ-
ment, and inflation in the near term and would pose con-
siderable risks to the economic outlook over the me-
dium term.  Participants assessed that the second quarter 
would likely see overall economic activity decline at an 
unprecedented rate.  Participants relayed information 
from their Districts that the burdens of the present crisis 
would fall disproportionately on the most vulnerable 
and financially constrained households in the economy.  
Participants agreed that recently enacted fiscal programs 
were delivering valuable direct financial aid to house-
holds, businesses, and communities that would provide 
some relief during the economic shutdown.  In addition, 
economic activity was being supported by actions taken 
by the Federal Reserve, including lending facilities cre-
ated under the authority of section 13(3) of the Federal 
Reserve Act, some of which included capital allocated by 
the U.S. Treasury.  These programs had helped maintain 
the flow of credit to households, businesses, and state 
and local governments, while supporting the smooth 
functioning of financial markets. 
Regarding the economic activity of households, partici-
pants noted that the pandemic and efforts to mitigate the 
spread of the disease were having severely adverse ef-
fects on aggregate household spending and consumer 
confidence.  Participants reported that consumer spend-
ing had plummeted across all parts of the country and in 
most categories of spending, with especially sharp de-
clines in expenditures for categories that had been most 
affected by social distancing, such as hotel, fuel, air 
travel, restaurant, theater, and other retail products and 
services.  Participants noted that even after government-

imposed social-distancing restrictions came to an end, 
consumer spending in these categories likely would not 
return quickly to more normal levels.  Survey-based 
measures of consumer confidence also plunged, a devel-
opment that participants and District contacts attributed 
to households’ concerns regarding the risk of job loss or 
difficulty in meeting financial obligations.  Participants 
noted that some households experiencing job losses may 
not immediately face lower total income because of the 
support from recently enacted fiscal programs.  Even in 
such cases, however, participants observed that house-
hold spending would likely be held down by a decrease 
in confidence and an increase in precautionary saving. 
Participants noted that business activity and investment 
spending had also fallen dramatically since the previous 
meeting as a result of efforts to contain the coronavirus 
outbreak.  Manufacturing output declined sharply in 
March and was expected by participants to drop even 
more rapidly in April.  In all Districts, some businesses 
had been forced to close temporarily because of social 
distancing restrictions.  Businesses that were able to re-
main open to some degree were also substantially af-
fected by the pandemic, with many experiencing either 
substantial drops in new orders and sales or supply chain 
disruptions.  There were widespread reports from Dis-
trict contacts of firms reducing their payrolls and curtail-
ing plans for investment spending.  Some industries were 
especially hard hit, including airlines, cruise ships, restau-
rants, and tourism.  Participants reported that many 
firms were seeking loans, payment deferrals, or grants to 
help address critical financial obligations and that the 
Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) was providing val-
uable assistance to small businesses in this respect.  Par-
ticipants also noted the disproportionate burdens or par-
ticular challenges being faced by small businesses; these 
challenges included lower cash buffers, fewer financing 
options, and, more recently, tighter lending standards.  
Participants expressed concerns that a large number of 
small businesses may not be able to endure a shock that 
had long-lasting financial effects.  Participants were fur-
ther concerned that even after social-distancing require-
ments were eased, some business models may no longer 
be economically viable, which could occur, for example, 
if consumers voluntarily continued to avoid participating 
in particular forms of economic activity.  In addition, 
participants expressed concern that the possibility of 
secondary outbreaks of the virus may cause businesses 
for some time to be reluctant to engage in new projects, 
rehire workers, or make new capital expenditures.  
Participants observed that conditions in the energy sec-
tor had become especially difficult.  A sharp reduction 

Page 8Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ 
in global demand for petroleum had led to unused sup-
ply that was overwhelming storage capacity, resulting in 
a plunge in oil prices.  Some participants expressed con-
cern that low energy prices, if they were to persist, had 
the potential to create a wave of bankruptcies in the en-
ergy sector.  In addition, the agricultural sector was un-
der severe stress due to falling prices for some farm 
commodities and pandemic-related disruptions, such as 
the closing of some food processing plants. 
With regard to the labor market, participants noted that 
incoming data confirmed that an extreme decline in em-
ployment was under way.  Nationally, initial claims for 
unemployment insurance benefits had totaled more than 
25 million from mid-March to the time of the meeting, 
and participants expected that the unemployment rate 
would soon reach the highest levels of the post–World 
War II period.  District contacts reported that a signifi-
cant portion of workers had been able to switch to work-
ing remotely.  Although many employers were trying to 
keep workers on their payrolls, over time, as conditions 
persisted, there had begun to be widespread furloughs 
and layoffs.  Participants were concerned that temporary 
layoffs could become permanent, and that workers who 
lose employment could face a loss of job-specific skills 
or may become discouraged and exit the labor force.  
Participants were additionally concerned that employees 
who were on low incomes would be the most severely 
affected by job cuts because they were employed in the 
industries most affected by the response to the outbreak 
or because their jobs were not amenable to being carried 
out remotely. 
With regard to inflation, participants noted that it had 
been running below the Committee’s 2 percent longer-
run objective before the coronavirus outbreak.  While 
the pandemic had created some supply constraints, 
which had generated upward pressure on the prices of 
some goods, the pandemic had also reduced demand, 
which had exerted downward pressure on prices.  The 
overall effect of the outbreak on prices was seen as dis-
inflationary.  In addition, a stronger dollar and lower oil 
prices were factors likely to put downward pressure on 
inflation, and market-based measures of inflation com-
pensation remained very low.  Participants observed that 
the return of inflation to the Committee’s 2 percent 
longer-run objective would likely be further delayed but 
that the accommodative stance of monetary policy 
would be helpful in achieving the 2 percent inflation ob-
jective over the longer run. 
Participants noted that recently enacted fiscal programs 
were crucial for limiting the severity of the economic 

downturn.  In particular, the Cares Act and other legis-
lation, which represented more than $2 trillion in federal 
spending in total, had provided direct help to house-
holds, businesses, and communities.  For example, the 
PPP was providing a financial lifeline to small busi-
nesses, the expansion of unemployment benefits was 
helping restore lost income for laid-off workers, and the 
Treasury had provided a necessary financial backstop to 
many Federal Reserve lending facilities.  Participants 
acknowledged that even greater fiscal support may be 
necessary if the economic downturn persists. 
Participants commented that, in addition to weighing 
heavily on economic activity in the near term, the eco-
nomic effects of the pandemic created an extraordinary 
amount of uncertainty and considerable risks to eco-
nomic activity in the medium term.  Participants dis-
cussed several alternative scenarios with regard to the 
behavior of economic activity in the medium term that 
all seemed about equally likely.  These scenarios differed 
in the assumed length of the pandemic and the conse-
quent economic disruptions.  On the one hand, a num-
ber of participants judged that there was a substantial 
likelihood of additional waves of outbreak in the near or 
medium term.  In such scenarios, it was believed likely 
that there would be further economic disruptions, in-
cluding additional periods of mandatory social distanc-
ing, greater supply chain dislocations, and a substantial 
number of business closures and loss of income; in total, 
such developments could lead to a protracted period of 
severely reduced economic activity.  On the other hand, 
economic activity could recover more quickly if the pan-
demic subsided enough for households and businesses 
to become sufficiently confident to relax or modify so-
cial-distancing behaviors over the next several months.  
Beyond these considerations, participants noted the risk 
that foreign economies, particularly EMEs, could come 
under extreme pressure as a result of the pandemic and 
that this strain could spill over to and hamper U.S. eco-
nomic activity.  Participants stressed that measures taken 
in the areas of health-care policy and fiscal policy, to-
gether with actions by the private sector, would be im-
portant in shaping the timing and speed of the 
U.S. economy’s return to more normal conditions.  In 
addition, participants agreed that recent actions taken by 
the Federal Reserve were essential in helping reduce 
downside risks to the economic outlook. 
Participants also noted several risks to long-term eco-
nomic performance that were posed by the pandemic.  
One of these risks was that workers who lose employ-
ment as a result of the pandemic may experience a loss 
of skills, lose access to adequate childcare or eldercare,

or become discouraged and exit the labor force.  The 
longer-term behavior of firms could be affected as 
well—for instance, if necessary but costly transmission-
mitigation strategies lowered firms’ productivity; if busi-
ness investment shifted down permanently; if many 
firms need to adjust their business models in the after-
math of the pandemic; or if business closures, particu-
larly those of small firms, became widespread.  A few 
participants noted that higher levels of government in-
debtedness, which would be exacerbated by fiscal ex-
penditures that were necessary to combat the economic 
effects of the pandemic, could put downward pressure 
on growth in aggregate potential output. 
Regarding developments in financial markets, partici-
pants agreed that ongoing actions by the Federal Reserve 
had been instrumental in easing strains in some essential 
financial markets and supporting the flow of credit.  
These actions included large-scale purchases of Treasury 
securities and agency MBS, measures to reduce strains in 
global U.S. dollar funding markets, and the launch of 
programs to support the flow of credit in the economy 
for households, businesses of all sizes, and state and lo-
cal governments.  Banks had entered the crisis well cap-
italized and had been able to provide necessary credit to 
businesses and households. 
A number of participants commented on potential risks 
to financial stability.  Participants were concerned that 
banks could come under greater stress, particularly if ad-
verse scenarios for the spread of the pandemic and eco-
nomic activity were realized, and so this sector should be 
monitored carefully.  Participants saw risks to banks and 
some other financial institutions as exacerbated by high 
levels of indebtedness among nonfinancial corporations 
that prevailed before the pandemic; this indebtedness in-
creased these firms’ risk of insolvency.  The upcoming 
financial stress tests for banks were seen as important 
for measuring the ability of large banks to withstand fu-
ture downside scenarios.  A number of participants em-
phasized that regulators should encourage banks to pre-
pare for possible downside scenarios by further limiting 
payouts to shareholders, thereby preserving loss-absorb-
ing capital.  Indeed, historical loss models might under-
state losses in this context.  A few participants stressed 
that the activities of some nonbank financial institutions 
presented vulnerabilities to the financial system that 
could worsen in the event of a protracted economic 
downturn and that these institutions and activities 
should be monitored closely. 

In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, 
participants noted that the Federal Reserve was commit-
ted to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. 
economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its 
maximum employment and price stability goals.  In light 
of their assessment that the ongoing public health crisis 
would weigh heavily on economic activity, employment, 
and inflation in the near term and posed considerable 
risks to the economic outlook over the medium term, all 
participants judged that it would be appropriate to main-
tain the target range for the federal funds rate at 
0 to ¼ percent.  Keeping the target range at the effective 
lower bound, after quickly reducing it by 150 basis points 
in March, would continue to provide support to the 
economy and promote the Committee’s maximum em-
ployment and price stability goals.  Participants also 
judged that it would be appropriate to maintain the tar-
get range for the federal funds rate at its present level 
until policymakers were confident that the economy had 
weathered recent events and was on track to achieve the 
Committee’s maximum employment and price stability 
goals. 
Participants also assessed that it was appropriate for the 
Federal Reserve to continue to purchase Treasury secu-
rities and agency residential-mortgage-backed securities 
(RMBS) and CMBS in the amounts needed to support 
smooth market functioning.  These open market pur-
chases would continue to support the flow of credit to 
households and businesses and thereby foster the effec-
tive transmission of monetary policy to broader financial 
conditions.  In addition, the Desk would continue to of-
fer large-scale overnight and term repo operations.  Par-
ticipants noted that it was important to continue to mon-
itor market conditions closely and that the Committee 
was prepared to adjust its plans as appropriate to support 
smooth functioning in the markets for these securities. 
Participants also commented that the multiple lending 
facilities established by the Federal Reserve under the 
authority of section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act 
and, in some cases, involving capital allocated by the 
Treasury were supporting financial market functioning 
and the flow of credit to households, businesses of all 
sizes, and state and local governments.  In this way, these 
emergency lending facilities were intended to help sup-
port the economy until pandemic-related credit market 
disruptions had abated.  Several participants commented 
further that it would be important for the Federal Re-
serve to remain ready to adjust these emergency lending 
facilities as appropriate based on its monitoring of finan-
cial market functioning and credit conditions. 

Page 10Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ 
While participants agreed that the current stance of 
monetary policy remained appropriate, they noted that 
the Committee could, at upcoming meetings, further 
clarify its intentions with respect to its future monetary 
policy decisions. Some participants commented that the 
Committee could make its forward guidance for the path 
for the federal funds rate more explicit.  For example, 
the Committee could adopt outcome-based forward 
guidance that would specify macroeconomic out-
comes—such as a certain level of the unemployment 
rate or of the inflation rate—that must be achieved be-
fore the Committee would consider raising the target 
range for the federal funds rate.  The Committee could 
also consider date-based forward guidance that would 
indicate that the target range could be raised only after a 
specified amount of time had elapsed.  These partici-
pants noted that such explicit forms of forward guidance 
could help ensure that the public’s expectations regard-
ing the future conduct of monetary policy continued to 
reflect the Committee’s intentions.  Several participants 
observed that the completion, most likely later this year, 
of the monetary policy framework review, together with 
the announcement of the conclusions arising from the 
review, would help further clarify the Committee’s in-
tentions with respect to its future monetary policy ac-
tions.  Several participants also remarked that the Com-
mittee may need to provide further clarity regarding its 
intentions for purchases of Treasury securities and 
agency MBS; these participants noted that, without fur-
ther communication on this matter, uncertainty about 
the evolution of the Federal Reserve’s asset purchases 
could increase over time.  Several participants remarked 
that a program of ongoing Treasury securities purchases 
could be used in the future to keep longer-term yields 
low.  A few participants also noted that the balance sheet 
could be used to reinforce the Committee’s forward 
guidance regarding the path of the federal funds rate 
through Federal Reserve purchases of Treasury securi-
ties on a scale necessary to keep Treasury yields at short- 
to medium-term maturities capped at specified levels for 
a period of time.   

Committee Policy Action  

In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, 
members agreed that the coronavirus outbreak was caus-
ing tremendous human and economic hardship across 
the United States and around the world.  The virus and 
the measures taken to protect public health were induc-
ing sharp declines in economic activity and a surge in job 
losses.  Consumer price inflation was being held down 
by weaker demand and significantly lower oil prices.  

The disruptions to global economic activity had signifi-
cantly affected financial conditions and impaired the 
flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.  Mem-
bers agreed that the Federal Reserve was committed to 
using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy 
in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum 
employment and price stability goals. 
Members further concurred that the ongoing public 
health crisis would weigh heavily on economic activity, 
employment, and inflation in the near term, and posed 
considerable downside risks to the economic outlook 
over the medium term.  In light of these developments, 
members decided to maintain the target range for the 
federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent.  Members noted 
that they expected to maintain this target range until they 
were confident that the economy had weathered recent 
events and was on track to achieve the Committee’s 
maximum employment and price stability goals. 
Members agreed that they would continue to monitor 
the implications of incoming information for the eco-
nomic outlook, including information related to public 
health, as well as global developments and muted infla-
tion pressures, and would use the Committee’s tools and 
act as appropriate to support the economy.  In determin-
ing the timing and size of future adjustments to the 
stance of monetary policy, members noted that they 
would assess realized and expected economic conditions 
relative to the Committee’s maximum employment ob-
jective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective.  
This assessment would take into account a wide range of 
information, including measures of labor market condi-
tions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation ex-
pectations, and readings on financial and international 
developments. 
To support the flow of credit to households and busi-
nesses, members agreed that it was appropriate for the 
Federal Reserve to continue to purchase Treasury secu-
rities and agency RMBS and CMBS in the amounts 
needed to support smooth market functioning, thereby 
fostering effective transmission of monetary policy to 
broader financial conditions. In addition, the Desk 
would continue to offer large-scale overnight and term 
repo operations.  Members agreed that they would 
closely monitor market conditions and be prepared to 
adjust their plans as appropriate. 
At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee 
voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank 
of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute 
transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the fol-
lowing domestic policy directive, for release at 2:00 p.m.:

• 

“Effective April 30, 2020, the Federal Open 
Market Committee directs the Desk to: 
• Undertake open market operations as nec-
essary to maintain the federal funds rate in 
a target range of 0 to ¼ percent. 
Increase the System Open Market Account 
holdings of Treasury securities, agency 
mortgage-backed securities (MBS), and 
agency commercial mortgage-backed secu-
rities (CMBS) in the amounts needed to 
support the smooth functioning of markets 
for these securities. 
• Conduct term and overnight repurchase 
agreement operations to support effective 
policy implementation and the smooth 
functioning of short-term U.S. dollar fund-
ing markets. 
• Conduct overnight reverse repurchase 
agreement operations at an offering rate of 
0.00 percent and with a per-counterparty 
limit of $30 billion per day; the per-counter-
party limit can be temporarily increased at 
the discretion of the Chair. 
• Roll over at auction all principal payments 
from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of 
Treasury securities and reinvest all principal 
payments from the Federal Reserve’s hold-
ings of agency debt and agency MBS in 
agency MBS and all principal payments 
from holdings of agency CMBS in agency 
CMBS. 
• Engage in dollar roll and coupon swap 
transactions as necessary to facilitate settle-
ment of the Federal Reserve’s agency MBS 
transactions.” 
The vote also encompassed approval of the statement 
below for release at 2:00 p.m.:   
“The Federal Reserve is committed to using its 
full range of tools to support the U.S. economy 
in this challenging time, thereby promoting its 
maximum employment and price stability goals. 
The coronavirus outbreak is causing tremen-
dous human and economic hardship across the 
United States and around the world.  The virus 
and the measures taken to protect public health 
are inducing sharp declines in economic activity 
and a surge in job losses.  Weaker demand and 
significantly lower oil prices are holding down 
consumer price inflation.  The disruptions to 

economic activity here and abroad have signifi-
cantly affected financial conditions and have 
impaired the flow of credit to U.S. households 
and businesses. 
The ongoing public health crisis will weigh 
heavily on economic activity, employment, and 
inflation in the near term, and poses considera-
ble risks to the economic outlook over the me-
dium term.  In light of these developments, the 
Committee decided to maintain the target range 
for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent.  The 
Committee expects to maintain this target range 
until it is confident that the economy has weath-
ered recent events and is on track to achieve its 
maximum employment and price stability goals. 
The Committee will continue to monitor the 
implications of incoming information for the 
economic outlook, including information re-
lated to public health, as well as global develop-
ments and muted inflation pressures, and will 
use its tools and act as appropriate to support 
the economy.  In determining the timing and 
size of future adjustments to the stance of mon-
etary policy, the Committee will assess realized 
and expected economic conditions relative to its 
maximum employment objective and its sym-

ket Desk will continue to offer large-scale over-
night and term repurchase agreement opera-
tions.  The Committee will closely monitor mar-
ket conditions and is prepared to adjust its plans 
as appropriate.” 
Voting for this action:  Jerome H. Powell, John C. 
Williams, Michelle W. Bowman, Lael Brainard, Richard 
H. Clarida, Patrick Harker, Robert S. Kaplan, Neel 
Kashkari, Loretta J. Mester, and Randal K. Quarles. 

Page 12Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ 
Voting against this action:  None. 

Consistent with the Committee’s decision to leave the 
target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the 
Board of Governors voted unanimously to leave the in-
terest rates on required and excess reserve balances at 
0.10 percent.  The Board of Governors also voted unan-
imously to approve establishment of the primary credit 
rate at the existing level of 0.25 percent, effective 
April 30, 2020. 
It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee 
would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, June 9–10, 
2020.  The meeting adjourned at 10:10 a.m. on April 29, 
2020. 

Notation Votes 

To address intensifying strains in global financial mar-
kets early in the intermeeting period, the Committee 
unanimously approved the following measures to help 
maintain the flow of credit to U.S. households and busi-
nesses: 
• By notation vote concluded on March 19, the Com-
mittee approved amendments to the Authorization 
for Foreign Currency Operations (“Foreign Author-
ization”) and to the Foreign Currency Directive 
(“Foreign Directive”). 3  The Foreign Authorization 
amendments authorized the establishment of tem-
porary U.S. dollar liquidity arrangements (swap 
lines).  The Foreign Directive was amended to direct 
the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to establish 
and maintain temporary dollar liquidity arrange-
ments with the Reserve Bank of Australia, the 
Banco Central do Brasil, the Danmarks National-
bank (Denmark), the Bank of Korea, the Banco de 
Mexico, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, the 
Norges Bank (Norway), the Monetary Authority of 
Singapore, and the Sveriges Riksbank (Sweden).  
These arrangements will be in place for at least six 
months.  Like the Federal Reserve’s standing U.S. 
dollar liquidity swap lines with the Bank of Canada, 
the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, the Euro-
pean Central Bank, and the Swiss National Bank, 
these temporary arrangements should help lessen 
heightened strains in global U.S. dollar funding mar-
kets, thereby mitigating the effects of these strains 
on the supply of credit to U.S. households and busi-
nesses. 

3 Committee organizational documents are available at 
https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/rules_au-
thorizations.htm. 

• By notation vote concluded on March 23, the Com-
mittee approved a statement indicating that the Fed-
eral Reserve will continue to purchase Treasury se-
curities and agency MBS in the amounts needed to 
support smooth market functioning and effective 
transmission of monetary policy to broader financial 
conditions and that these purchases will include 
agency CMBS.  In conjunction with approval of the 
statement, the Committee also authorized and di-
rected the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to 
execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance 
with these planned purchases.  Previously, the Com-
mittee had announced that it would purchase at least 
$500 billion of Treasury securities and at least 
$200 billion of agency MBS. 
• By notation vote concluded on March 31, the Com-
mittee amended the Authorization for Domestic 
Open Market Operations to authorize, and adopted 
a resolution to approve, the establishment of a tem-
porary repo facility for foreign and international 
monetary authorities (FIMA Repo Facility).3  The 
facility will be in place for at least six months and 
will allow FIMA account holders to temporarily ex-
change their U.S. Treasury securities held with the 
Federal Reserve for U.S. dollars, which can then be 
made available to institutions in their jurisdictions.  
By providing foreign and international monetary au-
thorities with an alternative temporary source of 
U.S. dollars other than sales of securities in the open 
market, the facility should help support the smooth 
functioning of the U.S. Treasury market.  In addi-
tion, the FIMA Repo Facility should—along with 
the U.S. dollar liquidity swap lines the Federal Re-
serve has established with other central banks—help 
ease strains in global U.S. dollar funding markets. 

By notation vote completed on April 7, 2020, the Com-
mittee unanimously approved the minutes of the Com-
mittee meeting held on March 15, 2020.
