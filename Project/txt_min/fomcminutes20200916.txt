Opening Remarks 

The Chair, Vice Chair Williams, and Governor Clarida 
opened the meeting with remarks in memory of Thomas 
Laubach. 

3 Attended Tuesday’s session only. 

Chair Powell: 
“Thomas was unquestionably one of the great 
economic minds of his generation, and his re-
search has been central to some of our biggest 
discussions and policy actions over the past sev-
eral years.  He had a rare and underappreciated 
gift for translating arcane and academic theory 
into real world practice.  That ability made a real 
difference in the conduct and communication 
of monetary policy.  From his work on r*, to the 
balance sheet, to leading the steering committee 
for our monetary policy review, Thomas Lau-
bach’s intellectual fingerprints are all over the 
Committee’s decisions that will define this era 
of the Federal Reserve. 
Thomas was also an exceptional colleague, 
leader, and friend.  No one here will be sur-
prised to know that as condolences pour in, the 
admiration for his kindness and equanimity 
match, if not exceed, the esteem for his intellect.  
Thomas was a model of leadership who fiercely 
believed that every member of his team is criti-
cal to our collective success, and he made cer-
tain they knew it.  Even as he battled his own 
health problems, working through treatment to 
help fight the economic fallout of a global pan-
demic, his concern lay with others.  Amid a del-
uge of emergency work to fight a historic down-
turn and the upending of daily life, Thomas 
urged people to take care of themselves and 
their families first.  It is a testament to the mu-
tual respect and amity that it was Thomas’s team 
who proposed the Tealbook dedication in his 
memory. 
As friends, colleagues, and collaborators, we all 
grieve his loss.  His absence leaves a space that 
cannot truly be filled.  We will miss Thomas 
Laubach’s intellect and his insight.  More im-
portantly, we will miss Thomas Laubach.” 
Vice Chair Williams: 
“Thomas and I started working together 
20 years ago.  He had just arrived at the Board 
from the Kansas City Fed, and I had returned 
from my stint at the Council of Economic Ad-
visers.  And it was truly serendipitous.  We im-
mediately recognized the shared interest in fig-
uring out how to estimate this thing called the 

Page 2Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                            
natural rate of interest.  And more importantly, 
Thomas was an expert in Kalman filtering.  So 
we were off to the races on that project.  Ironi-
cally, given subsequent events, the question of 
the time was whether the productivity boom 
had driven r* higher.  In fact, if you go back to 
our December 2000 memo, our first memo to 
the Board on r*, our original estimates had r* at 
4¼ percent, and that’s real, not nominal.  So 
that’s a 6¼ percent nominal r*.  Those were the 
days. 
Jumping ahead 15 years, following his appoint-
ment as Director of Monetary Affairs, Thomas 
would frequently, and very earnestly, ask me 
how he could be most effective in his role as an 
adviser to the FOMC.  And I’d remind him that 
the Committee has at times been compared to a 
herd of cats.  But he was always looking for 
ways to raise his game, and hopefully ours, and 
help the Committee grapple with issues and de-
cisions before us.  Sometimes that effort led to 
briefings with a labyrinth of charts and figures, 
where Thomas heroically tried to make sense of 
our Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) 
projections and the implicit policy rule that 
must be embedded in them if you only looked 
hard enough.  Or it goes without saying how 
everything makes more sense once you factor in 
r*. 
His role as trusted adviser was never more on 
display or important than during the framework 
review as Chair Powell 
just commented.  
Thomas focused on making sure the Commit-
tee was prepared with the very best information 
and analysis.  He consistently moved us towards 
the goal line, even as he engaged in a complex 
range of issues and dealt with the effects of the 
pandemic.  And he scrupulously played the role 
of honest broker throughout.  Indeed, he per-
fected the formula for herding cats.  It’s one 
part keen intellect, a dollop of understated hu-
mor, and a big helping of patience and persever-
ance.” 
Governor Clarida: 
“Thomas Laubach was a remarkable human be-
ing who just happened to be a world class econ-
omist.  His passing last week represents of 
course an incalculable loss for his family, but is 
also a devastating blow felt by each and every 
one of us in the Federal Reserve System, and 

indeed, in major central banks around the world 
that he frequently visited. 
Before I arrived at the Board, I knew Thomas 
primarily through his research.  His book on in-
flation targeting with Ben Bernanke, Rick Mish-
kin, and Adam Posen is a classic reference on 
the subject, as is his work with President Wil-
liams on r*.  I would say Thomas had a talent 
for picking co-authors.  Thomas and I first met 
when he was a Ph.D. student working on the 
book and we were both visiting the New York 
Fed.   
I remember well our first meeting 25 years ago, 
and I was struck then by Thomas’s enthusiasm 
that he brought to economics as a graduate stu-
dent.  Thomas of course never lost that spark 
and joy for the practice of monetary policy, and 
we are all fortunate that he did not.  I—and I’m 
sure Chair Powell, and before him, Chair 
Yellen—trusted him implicitly.  And speaking 
for myself, I always sought his insight and ad-
vice privately in my office and counsel on all of 
the big policy decisions I’ve had to consider in 
my two years as Vice Chair. 
Thomas made everyone that he worked with 
better and inspired to put forth their best energy 
and effort to achieve larger goals.  That was 
most certainly the case in the framework review, 
and I’ll second what Vice Chair Williams and 
Chair Powell said.  Thomas brought peerless 
leadership, energy, and a commitment to the en-
tire framework review.  We simply would not 
have achieved the evolution of our framework 
and strategy without Thomas and the insight, 
inspiration, and good judgment he brought to 
the project and the ambitious process that he 
designed and worked with us to implement. 
I understand that in Thomas’s last days, he was 
able to watch the Chair’s speech at Jackson 
Hole rolling out the new framework, and that 
he was so proud to have been part of what the 
Wall Street Journal called a landmark change in 
U.S. monetary policy.  I’m sure I speak for all of 
us when I conclude by saying that it is we who 
are proud to have had the privilege of working 
with Thomas Laubach during his 20 years at the 
Fed.  He is and will be deeply missed, but his 
spirit and inspiration to us all will endure.”

Developments in Financial Markets and Open 
Market Operations 

The System Open Market Account (SOMA) manager 
first discussed developments in financial markets.  On 
net, financial conditions eased over the intermeeting pe-
riod.  Equity prices rose and the broad dollar continued 
to depreciate from its crisis-driven peak in March.  
Yields on Treasury inflation-protected securities fell, 
while longer-dated nominal Treasury yields increased 
modestly.  
Market participants attributed these developments to a 
stronger economic outlook, better news on the COVID-
19 trajectory, better-than-feared corporate earnings re-
ports, and accommodative policy.  Against this back-
drop, most respondents to the Open Market Desk’s Sur-
vey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Partici-
pants perceived downside risks to U.S. gross domestic 
product (GDP) growth this year as having declined no-
tably since the July survey, and their forecasts for overall 
growth for 2020 were revised up significantly. 
While the economic outlook had brightened, market 
participants continued to see significant risks ahead.  
Some noted concerns about elevated asset valuations in 
certain sectors.  Many also cited geopolitical events as 
heightening uncertainty.  In addition, most forecasters 
were assuming that an additional pandemic-related fiscal 
package would be approved this year, and noted that, 
absent a new package, growth could decelerate at a 
faster-than-expected pace in the fourth quarter.  In light 
of these and other risks, as well as the ongoing pan-
demic, market participants continued to suggest that the 
supportive policy environment and the backstops to 
market functioning remained important stabilizers. 
The release of the revised Statement on Longer-Run 
Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy (consensus state-
ment) elicited relatively modest immediate reaction 
across markets.  However, market participants generally 
viewed the completion of the review as an important 
milestone; many indicated that growing expectations for 
the Committee to adopt a flexible average-inflation- 
targeting regime had influenced asset prices over recent 
months.  In particular, these expectations were viewed 
as contributing to the recent rise in far-forward measures 
of inflation compensation, though market participants 
noted that these measures were still somewhat low by 
historical standards.  
Market participants continued to anticipate that the 
Committee would update its forward guidance for the 
federal funds rate.  Most respondents to the Desk’s sur-
veys continued to indicate that they expected the FOMC 

to adopt outcome-based forward guidance linked to in-
flation; some noted that employment measures could be 
part of the forward guidance as well.  Survey respond-
ents’ expectations for the economic conditions that 
would prevail when the FOMC first lifted the target 
range had shifted notably since the previous survey, with 
many respondents projecting somewhat higher inflation 
and lower unemployment than in July.  Expectations for 
asset purchases this year remained tightly centered 
around the current pace; however, many survey re-
spondents revised up the amount of asset purchases ex-
pected in 2021 and 2022. 
The manager turned next to a discussion of funding mar-
ket conditions and open market operations over the pe-
riod.  Conditions in short-term dollar funding markets 
remained stable over the period.  Overnight secured and 
unsecured rates continued to trade in narrow ranges near 
the interest on excess reserves rate.  Forward measures 
of funding rates implied that conditions were expected 
to remain stable in coming months. 
Markets for Treasury securities and agency mortgage-
backed securities 
(MBS) continued 
to 
function 
smoothly, with bid-ask spreads and a range of other in-
dicators remaining near pre-pandemic levels.  Indicators 
of functioning in the market for agency commercial 
mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) also remained sta-
ble.  In light of the improved conditions, the staff pro-
posed that the Desk no longer be required to increase 
agency CMBS holdings or reinvest principal payments 
for agency CMBS.  For the time being, the Desk would 
continue to conduct regular agency CMBS operations to 
maintain backstop capacity.   
By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s 
domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. 
There were no intervention operations in foreign curren-
cies for the System’s account during the intermeeting pe-
riod.  

Staff Review of the Economic Situation 

The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures undertaken 
to contain its spread continued to affect economic activ-
ity in the United States and abroad.  The information 
available at the time of the September 15–16 meeting 
suggested that U.S. real GDP was rebounding at a rapid 
rate in the third quarter.  Labor market conditions con-
tinued to improve markedly in July and August, but em-
ployment was still below its level at the beginning of the 
year.  Consumer price inflation—as measured by the 
12-month percentage change in the price index for per-
sonal consumption expenditures (PCE) through July—

Page 4Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ 
 
 
remained well below the rates that prevailed early in the 
year. 
Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded strongly in 
July and August, although payrolls had retraced only 
about half of the jobs lost at the onset of the pandemic.  
The unemployment rate moved down further to 8.4 per-
cent in August.  The unemployment rates for African 
Americans, Asians, and Hispanics declined over the past 
two months but remained well above the national aver-
age.  The labor force participation rate rose, on net, and 
the employment-to-population ratio increased further in 
July and August.  Initial claims for unemployment insur-
ance benefits continued to move down, on net, through 
early September, but the pace of declines had slowed.  In 
addition, weekly estimates of private-sector payrolls con-
structed by the Board’s staff using data provided by the 
payroll processor ADP suggested that employment gains 
likely were still solid from mid-August to early Septem-
ber. 
Total PCE price inflation was 1.0 percent over the 
12 months ending in July, reflecting both weak aggregate 
demand and a considerable drop in consumer energy 
prices early this year.  Core PCE price inflation, which 
excludes changes in consumer food and energy prices, 
was 1.3 percent over the same 12-month period.  By 
comparison, the trimmed mean measure of 12-month 
PCE price inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve 
Bank of Dallas was 1.8 percent in July.  The consumer 
price 
index (CPI) 
increased 1.3 percent over the 
12 months ending in August, while core CPI inflation 
was 1.7 percent over the same period.  On a monthly 
basis, recent inflation readings were bolstered by in-
creases in durable goods prices, largely reflecting the 
strong demand for consumer goods as household pur-
chases shifted away from many consumer services.  The 
latest readings on survey-based measures of longer-run 
inflation expectations moved up a bit but remained 
within their ranges in recent years.  The University of 
Michigan Surveys of Consumers measure for the next 
5 to 10 years edged up in July and August, and the three-
year-ahead measure from the Federal Reserve Bank of 
New York’s Survey of Consumer Expectations also 
crept up over the past two months. 
Real PCE expanded strongly in July and continued to be 
bolstered by supportive fiscal and monetary policy ac-
tions.  In August, the components of retail sales used to 
estimate PCE, along with sales of light motor vehicles, 
increased further.  However, recent high-frequency indi-
cators of spending on some consumer services—such as 
restaurant dining, hotel accommodations, and air 

travel—were still subdued.  Real disposable personal in-
come was roughly flat in July, primarily reflecting further 
gains in wage and salary income that were largely offset 
by the waning of government transfer payments from 
their peak in the spring.  Nevertheless, the personal sav-
ing rate remained quite elevated.  The consumer senti-
ment measure from the Michigan survey edged up in 
August, while the Conference Board survey measure 
moved down; both measures continued to be below 
their levels at the beginning of the year. 
Housing-sector activity continued to expand, likely sup-
ported by the effects of low interest rates.  Starts and 
building permit issuance for single-family homes, along 
with starts of multifamily units, increased further in July.  
Sales of both new and existing homes also rose substan-
tially further.  These measures of construction and sales 
were generally at or near their pre-pandemic levels. 
Indicators of business fixed investment suggested that 
this sector was beginning to recover on balance.  Nomi-
nal new orders and shipments of nondefense capital 
goods excluding aircraft increased in July, the third con-
secutive monthly increase in these indicators of business 
equipment spending.  Many measures of business senti-
ment also improved somewhat in July and August.  In 
addition, the number of crude oil and natural gas rigs in 
operation through early September—an indicator of 
business spending on structures in the drilling and min-
ing sector—had flattened out recently following its de-
clines since the spring.  In contrast, nominal business 
spending on nonresidential structures outside of the 
drilling and mining sector declined over June and July.   
Industrial production expanded further in July and Au-
gust, although at a less rapid pace than over the preced-
ing two months.   The increase in factory output was 
broad based, but the gains for most manufacturing in-
dustries had slowed gradually since June.  Production in 
the mining sector—which includes crude oil and natural 
gas drilling and extraction—increased in July but fell in 
August, as Tropical Storm Marco and Hurricane Laura 
caused sharp but temporary decreases in extraction and 
drilling.  
Total real government purchases appeared to be increas-
ing modestly, on balance, in the third quarter.  Federal 
defense spending continued to rise through August, and 
federal employment was boosted markedly by temporary 
census-related hiring.  State and local government pay-
rolls expanded in July and August, although nominal 
state and local construction expenditures decreased in 
June and July. 

Minutes of the Meeting of September 15–16, 2020Page 5_____________________________________________________________________________________________ 
 
 
After declining sharply earlier this year, exports and im-
ports of goods and services increased strongly in June 
and July.  On net, over these two months, the nominal 
U.S. international trade deficit widened, as imports rose 
more than exports.  Exports and imports of goods rose 
in June and July in most major product categories, while 
exports and imports of services rose modestly following 
previous historic declines. 
Foreign economic activity plunged in the second quarter 
as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the associ-
ated restrictive measures to contain it.  With some of 
these measures having been rolled back in recent 
months, economic indicators pointed to a large, but par-
tial, rebound in most foreign economies in the third 
quarter.  Recent indicators of household and business 
spending were strong in several economies (including 
Canada, the euro area, and Brazil), reflecting in part a 
boost from substantial government support programs.  
In China, economic indicators showed a continued 
moderate expansion after a sharp rebound in the second 
quarter, though gains in consumption continued to lag 
those in production and exports.  Similarly, in Mexico, a 
strong rebound in manufacturing production contrasted 
with weak services activity.  Despite the widespread re-
bound in foreign activity indicators, a resurgence in 
COVID-19 cases in parts of Europe and Asia added un-
certainty to the outlook for those economies.  Recent 
readings of headline and core inflation abroad remained 
quite low, particularly in the advanced foreign econo-
mies (AFEs), amid subdued demand pressures and 
lower energy prices from earlier this year. 

Staff Review of the Financial Situation 

Financial market sentiment improved over the inter-
meeting period, boosted by declines in the number of 
new COVID-19 cases in the United States and stronger-
than-anticipated corporate earnings reports and domes-
tic economic data releases.  Broad stock price indexes 
rose, on net, despite notable declines late in the inter-
meeting period.  Inflation compensation increased fur-
ther, reaching pre-pandemic levels.  Changes in other as-
set prices were generally more modest but were con-
sistent with improved sentiment:  The Treasury yield 
curve steepened a little, spreads on speculative-grade 
corporate bonds narrowed moderately, and the ex-
change value of the dollar depreciated modestly.  Mean-
while, financing conditions for businesses with access to 
capital markets and households with high credit scores 
remained broadly accommodative, although conditions 
remained tight for other borrowers. 

Yields on 2-year nominal Treasury securities were little 
changed since the July FOMC meeting, while 10- and 
30-year yields rose moderately.  Market commentary at-
tributed the increases in longer-term yields to improved 
investor sentiment.  This improved sentiment partly re-
flected the decline in new COVID-19 cases in the United 
States and stronger-than-expected economic data, al-
though market reactions to economic data releases were 
limited.  The near-dated implied volatility on 10-year 
Treasury securities was little changed over the intermeet-
ing period and remained near the bottom of its historical 
range.  Measures of inflation compensation based on 
TIPS maturing over the next few years continued to in-
crease, likely reflecting the general improvement in in-
vestor sentiment accompanying the improvement in the 
economic outlook, some further improvements in TIPS 
market liquidity, and the higher-than-expected July CPI 
data release.  The 5-year and 5-to-10-year measures of 
inflation compensation were close to their pre-pandemic 
levels but were still in the lower end of their historical 
ranges.  
The expected path for the federal funds rate over the 
next few years, as implied by a straight read of overnight 
index swap quotes, was little changed, on net, since the 
July FOMC meeting and remained close to the effective 
lower bound (ELB) through the first half of 2024. Com-
munications about monetary policy over the intermeet-
ing period generally had little effect on Treasury yields 
or the expected path of the federal funds rate.  However, 
market participants suggested that building expectations 
that the Committee would move to a form of flexible 
average inflation targeting under the revised consensus 
statement had been a factor boosting TIPS inflation 
compensation over recent months. 
Broad stock price indexes rose, on net, during the inter-
meeting period, consistent with generally better-than-ex-
pected news on both the economy and second-quarter 
corporate earnings.  One-month option-implied volatil-
ity on the S&P 500—the VIX—was roughly unchanged, 
on net, although measures of longer-term downside risks 
in equity markets, such as the option-implied cost of in-
suring against a 10 percent decline in the S&P 500 index 
in three months, increased somewhat.  Spreads of invest-
ment- and speculative-grade corporate bond yields over 
comparable-maturity Treasury yields narrowed some-
what and remained near their historical medians.   
Conditions in short-term funding markets were stable 
over the intermeeting period.  Spreads on commercial 
paper (CP) and negotiable certificates of deposit across 
different tenors changed little, on net, and remained 

Page 6Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ 
 
 
around levels observed before the pandemic.  Total 
gross CP issuance also remained within pre-pandemic 
normal ranges, although outstanding volumes of nonfi-
nancial CP declined moderately since the July FOMC 
meeting.  Assets under management of prime and gov-
ernment money market funds (MMFs) declined mod-
estly on net.  Partly reversing changes observed between 
April and July, institutional government MMFs, on net, 
decreased their holdings of Treasury securities and in-
creased their holdings of repurchase agreements (repos) 
in August.  The reversal was driven in part by a tighter 
spread between Treasury bill yields and repo rates.  Amid 
normalizing market conditions, there was little activity in 
the Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility or the 
Commercial Paper Funding Facility.   
The effective federal funds rate and the Secured Over-
night Financing Rate averaged 9 basis points over the 
intermeeting period.  The amount of Federal Reserve 
repo outstanding remained at zero over the intermeeting 
period due to more attractive rates in the private market.  
Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve increased holdings of 
Treasury securities and agency MBS at the same pace as 
during the previous intermeeting period.   
Foreign asset price movements were generally muted, 
with market participants likely weighing concerns over 
rising infection rates in some countries against the pro-
spect of a COVID-19 vaccine.  In emerging market 
economies (EMEs), Asian equity markets significantly 
outperformed Latin American counterparts, with Chi-
nese equities showing particular strength.  In most 
AFEs, equity indexes rose modestly and long-term sov-
ereign yields edged higher. 
In line with the modest improvement in risk sentiment, 
the staff’s broad dollar index declined moderately, on 
net, with the dollar depreciating more against EME cur-
rencies.  The Chinese renminbi was boosted by better-
than-expected Chinese economic data and was the most 
notable contributor to the decline in the staff’s trade-
weighted dollar index, along with the Mexican peso.  
Among AFE currencies, the euro appreciated further 
and reached its highest level against the dollar since 
2018.  The pound was little changed, as some of its ear-
lier appreciation against the dollar unwound amid a re-
surgence of Brexit-related uncertainty. 
Financing conditions in capital markets remained ac-
commodative over the intermeeting period.  Amid his-
torically low corporate bond yields, gross issuance of 
both investment- and speculative-grade corporate bonds 
was strong in July and August.  Much of this recent issu-

ance was intended to refinance existing debt.  Gross in-
stitutional leveraged loan issuance picked up slightly in 
July but remained below the levels observed during the 
same period last year.  Amid notable equity market gains 
in August, gross equity issuance was robust, as seasoned 
offerings strengthened to about double their typical 
pace.  Commercial and industrial loans outstanding de-
clined in July and August, but at a slower pace than in 
June, with declines in large part reflecting continued 
credit-line repayment.   
The credit quality of nonfinancial corporations showed 
tentative signs of stabilization over the intermeeting pe-
riod.  The dollar volume of nonfinancial corporate bond 
downgrades continued to exceed upgrades, albeit only 
modestly, representing a sizable reduction in net down-
grades since the spring.  The pace of nonfinancial cor-
porate bond defaults in July was also notably lower than 
in April and May but was still elevated relative to pre-
pandemic levels.  Default volumes fell further in August, 
reaching a level below the 2019 monthly average.  Mar-
ket indicators of future default expectations also im-
proved somewhat.   
Financing conditions for small businesses remained 
tight, although some indicators pointed to a slight im-
provement.  Thirty-day delinquency rates fell modestly 
between May and July but remained comparable with 
early 2008 levels.  The credit needs of small businesses 
remained high, with significant shares of respondents to 
the Census Bureau’s Small Business Pulse Survey report-
ing scarce cash availability and anticipating a need for fi-
nancial assistance in the next six months.   
Municipal market financing conditions remained accom-
modative since the July FOMC meeting.  However, the 
credit quality of municipal debt deteriorated somewhat, 
driven by a relatively large volume of credit rating down-
grades of revenue bonds. 
Financing conditions for commercial real estate (CRE) 
intermediated through capital markets recovered further 
over the intermeeting period.  Spreads on triple-B non-
agency CMBS remained wide, though they continued to 
narrow through August, while triple-A spreads remained 
close to pre-pandemic levels.  Issuance of non-agency 
CMBS was steady but subdued relative to pre-pandemic 
levels.  Spreads on agency CMBS were tight and issuance 
was very strong, setting a new single-month record in 
July.  In contrast, CRE loan growth at banks was weak 
in July and August, likely partly driven by the recovery 
of CMBS markets.  Delinquency rates on mortgages 
backing CMBS fell a bit in July but remained high in the 
hotel and retail sectors.

Financing conditions in the residential mortgage market 
were little changed over the intermeeting period.  While 
mortgage rates hovered near historical lows, the spread 
between primary mortgage rates and MBS yields re-
mained quite wide.  Credit continued to flow to higher-
score borrowers who met standard conforming loan cri-
teria, while it remained tight for borrowers with lower 
credit scores and for nonstandard mortgage products.  
Nonetheless, low mortgage rates were supporting both 
home-purchase originations and refinancing.  The credit 
quality of mortgages improved slightly, with the rate of 
transition 
into delinquency 
remaining near pre- 
pandemic levels and forbearance continuing to slowly 
decline. 
Financing conditions in consumer credit markets re-
mained accommodative for borrowers with relatively 
strong credit scores but continued to be tight for sub-
prime borrowers.  Auto loan balances increased solidly 
overall but declined for borrowers with low credit 
scores.  Credit card balances contracted at a slower rate 
in June and July than in the spring.  However, offered 
interest rates rose and credit limits edged down for credit 
cards to nonprime borrowers.  Conditions in the asset-
backed securities (ABS) market were stable during the 
intermeeting period.  ABS spreads edged down, and auto 
and student loan issuance was robust.  Consumer credit 
performance remained stable, and the share of auto and 
credit card balances in forbearance declined. 

Staff Economic Outlook 

In the U.S. economic projection prepared by the staff 
for the September FOMC meeting, the rate of real GDP 
growth and the pace of declines in the unemployment 
rate were faster over the second half of this year than in 
the July forecast, primarily reflecting recent better-than-
expected data.  In addition, the inflation forecast for the 
rest of the year was revised up slightly, as some recent 
consumer goods prices were stronger than expected.  
Nevertheless, inflation was still projected to be subdued 
this year, reflecting substantial slack in resource utiliza-
tion and the sizable declines in consumer energy prices 
earlier this year.  Fiscal policy measures, along with the 
support from monetary policy and the Federal Reserve’s 
liquidity and lending facilities, were expected to continue 
supporting the second-half recovery, although the re-
covery was forecast to be far from complete by year-end.  
The staff’s forecast assumed the enactment of some ad-
ditional fiscal policy support this year; without that addi-
tional policy action, the pace of the economic recovery 
would likely be slower.   

In the staff’s medium-term projection, the baseline as-
sumptions included that the current restrictions on so-
cial interactions and business operations, along with vol-
untary social distancing by individuals and firms, would 
ease gradually through next year.  In addition, the staff 
projection assumed that monetary policy would be even 
more accommodative than in the previous forecast in 
order to more fully reflect the revised consensus state-
ment.  Altogether, the rate of real GDP growth was pro-
jected to exceed potential output growth, the unemploy-
ment rate was expected to decline considerably further, 
and inflation was forecast to pick back up in 2021 
through 2023.  With the more-accommodative monetary 
policy assumed in the current forecast, which reflected 
the recent consensus statement, inflation was projected 
to moderately overshoot 2 percent for some time in the 
years beyond 2023. 
The staff continued to observe that the uncertainty re-
lated to the course of the COVID-19 pandemic and its 
associated economic effects was extremely elevated and 
that the risks to the outlook were still tilted to the down-
side.  Given the apparent resilience of the U.S. economy 
to the acceleration in the spread of the pandemic during 
the summer, the staff judged that a significantly more 
pessimistic economic outcome, which the staff had pre-
viously viewed as no less plausible than the baseline fore-
cast and had featured a renewed downturn in economic 
activity, was now less likely than the baseline forecast.   

Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the 
Economic Outlook 

In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, participants 
submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes 
for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and infla-
tion for each year from 2020 through 2023 and over the 
longer run, based on their individual assessments of ap-
propriate monetary policy—including the path for the 
federal funds rate.  The longer-run projections repre-
sented each participant’s assessment of the rate to which 
each variable would be expected to converge, over time, 
under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of 
further shocks to the economy.  These projections are 
described in the SEP, which is an addendum to these 
minutes. 
Participants noted that the COVID-19 pandemic was 
causing tremendous human and economic hardship 
across the United States and around the world.  Eco-
nomic activity and employment had picked up in recent 
months but remained well below their levels at the be-
ginning of the year.  Weaker demand and significantly

lower oil prices were holding down consumer price in-
flation.  Overall financial conditions had improved in re-
cent months, in part reflecting policy measures to sup-
port the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. house-
holds and businesses.  Participants agreed that the path 
of the economy would depend on the course of the virus 
and that the ongoing public health crisis would continue 
to weigh on economic activity, employment, and infla-
tion in the near term and posed considerable risks to the 
economy’s medium-term outlook. 
Participants observed that the incoming data indicated 
that economic activity was recovering faster than ex-
pected from its depressed second-quarter level, when 
much of the economy was shut down to stem the spread 
of the virus.  In particular, with the reopening of many 
businesses and fewer people withdrawing from social in-
teractions, consumer spending was rebounding sharply 
and appeared to have recovered about three-fourths of 
its earlier decline.  Prior fiscal policy actions were seen 
as having supported the ability and willingness of house-
holds to spend, although most participants expressed 
concern about the expiration of the enhanced unem-
ployment insurance benefits from the CARES Act 
(Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act) 
and judged that additional fiscal relief would help sustain 
the recovery in household spending.  Indeed, many par-
ticipants noted that their economic outlook assumed ad-
ditional fiscal support and that if future fiscal support 
was significantly smaller or arrived significantly later 
than they expected, the pace of the recovery could be 
slower than anticipated.  Participants also viewed accom-
modative monetary policy as contributing to gains in res-
idential investment as well as consumer purchases of 
motor vehicles and other durable goods.  While partici-
pants pointed to strength in consumers’ purchases of 
goods, especially those sold online, they noted that out-
lays for services had been slower to recover, particularly 
for items such as air travel, hotel accommodations, and 
restaurant meals, which had been significantly disrupted 
by social-distancing measures.  Participants generally ex-
pected spending on these services to remain subdued for 
some time and thus to be a restraining factor on the pace 
of the recovery.  A few participants raised the possibility 
that the unwinding of the large pool of household sav-
ings accumulated during the pandemic could provide 
greater-than-anticipated momentum to consumption 
going forward.  However, a couple of other participants 
judged that if this savings reflected reduced spending on 
in-person services by high-income consumers, it was un-
likely to provide much momentum to future consump-
tion.  

Participants noted that business investment, which had 
plummeted in the second quarter, appeared to have be-
gun to turn around.  They pointed to data showing gains 
in capital goods orders and shipments as well as im-
proved business sentiment.  A number of participants 
judged that low interest rates were supporting business 
investment.  However, the recovery was viewed as une-
venly distributed across industries.  While many business 
contacts reported progress on adapting to the pandemic, 
others noted that industries that relied more on person-
to-person interactions continued to struggle.  Business 
contacts with ties to the motor vehicle or housing indus-
tries indicated increased activity, while those closer to 
the aviation, hospitality, and nonresidential construction 
industries were not seeing much of a recovery.  Contacts 
continued to report ongoing stresses in the energy sec-
tor, as well as challenges in the agricultural sector even 
though some crop prices had risen recently as sales to 
China increased.   
Although business contacts indicated that overall busi-
ness activity had been stronger than they expected, it re-
mained well below pre-pandemic levels.  Business con-
tacts pointed to several factors that could restrain further 
recovery, including high levels of uncertainty that were 
reportedly still holding back hiring and capital spending.  
Some contacts reported difficulties in managing disrup-
tions in supply chains as well as elevated levels of em-
ployee absenteeism because of the pandemic.  Addition-
ally, District contacts indicated that fiscal policy had 
helped support small businesses, while federal aid pay-
ments had helped support farm incomes.   
Participants observed that labor market conditions con-
tinued to improve in recent months and that the econ-
omy through August had regained roughly half of the 
22 million jobs that were lost in March and April.  The 
gains in employment over July and August were gener-
ally seen as larger than anticipated.  Participants judged, 
however, that the labor market was a long way from be-
ing fully recovered.  They generally agreed that prospects 
for a further substantial improvement in the labor mar-
ket would depend on a broad and sustained reopening 
of businesses, which in turn would depend importantly 
on how safe individuals felt to reengage in a wide range 
of activities.  Some participants noted that the majority 
of gains in employment so far reflected workers on tem-
porary layoffs returning to work.  These participants 
judged it as less likely for future job gains to continue at 
their recent pace, because a greater share of the remain-
ing layoffs might become permanent.  Workers facing 
permanent layoffs were seen as more likely to need to 
find new jobs in different industries, and this process

could take time, especially to the extent that these work-
ers needed to be retrained. 
Participants observed that lower-paid workers had been 
disproportionally affected by the economic effects of the 
pandemic.  Many of these workers were employed in the 
service sector or other industries most adversely affected 
by social-distancing measures.  With a disproportionate 
share of service-sector jobs held by African Americans, 
Hispanics, and women, these groups were seen as being 
especially hard hit by the economic hardships caused by 
the pandemic.  Participants viewed fiscal support from 
the CARES Act as having been very important in bol-
stering the financial situations of millions of families, and 
a number of participants judged that the absence of fur-
ther fiscal support would exacerbate economic hard-
ships in minority and lower-income communities.  In ad-
dition, several participants observed that the effects of 
the pandemic were disrupting the supply of labor be-
cause of the need to care for children, many of whom 
were attending school virtually from home. 
In their comments about inflation, participants noted 
that consumer prices had increased more quickly than 
expected in recent months and that market-based 
measures of inflation compensation had increased mod-
erately over the intermeeting period, although they re-
mained low.  The upturn in consumer prices was primar-
ily attributed to price increases in sectors such as con-
sumer durables in which demand had risen after experi-
encing a large decline earlier this spring.  Nevertheless, 
inflation remained subdued, and participants still gener-
ally judged that the overall effect of the pandemic on 
prices was disinflationary.  While the outlook for infla-
tion was viewed as highly uncertain, a number of partic-
ipants projected that inflation would run below the 
Committee’s 2 percent longer-run objective for a signif-
icant period before moving moderately above 2 percent 
for some time—consistent with the Committee’s revised 
consensus statement.   
Participants noted that financial conditions were gener-
ally accommodative and that actions by the Federal Re-
serve, including the establishment of emergency lending 
facilities in conjunction with the Treasury, were support-
ing the flow of credit to households, businesses, and 
communities.  While these actions as well as prompt and 
forceful monetary policy measures in response to the 
pandemic were viewed as contributing to accommoda-
tive financial conditions, participants noted important 
differences in credit quality and credit availability across 
borrowers.  While the pace of corporate downgrades was 
seen as having decreased significantly in recent months, 

the delinquency rates on business loans had risen notice-
ably.  Bank contacts reported ample capacity to lend to 
creditworthy borrowers; however, surveys of credit 
availability indicated that bank lending was tight.  Fur-
thermore, several participants noted the stress that 
small- and medium-sized banks could face from defaults 
on loans to small businesses and CRE properties if peo-
ple continued to withdraw from travel and shopping ac-
tivities.  Additionally, a couple of participants indicated 
that highly accommodative financial market conditions 
could lead to excessive risk-taking and to a buildup of 
financial imbalances. 
Participants continued to see the uncertainty surround-
ing the economic outlook as very elevated, with the path 
of the economy highly dependent on the course of the 
virus; on how individuals, businesses, and public officials 
responded to it; and on the effectiveness of public health 
measures to address it.  Participants cited several down-
side risks that could threaten the recovery.  While the 
risk of another broad economic shutdown was seen as 
having receded, participants remained concerned about 
the possibility of additional virus outbreaks that could 
undermine the recovery.  Such scenarios could result in 
increases in bankruptcies and defaults, put stress on the 
financial system, and lead to disruptions in the flow of 
credit to households and businesses.  Most participants 
raised the concern that fiscal support so far for house-
holds, businesses, and state and local governments might 
not provide sufficient relief to these sectors.  A couple 
of participants saw an upside risk that further fiscal stim-
ulus could be larger than anticipated, though it might 
come later than had been expected.  Several participants 
raised concerns regarding the longer-run effects of the 
pandemic, including how it could lead to a restructuring 
in some sectors of the economy that could slow employ-
ment growth or could accelerate technological disrup-
tion that was likely limiting the pricing power of firms.   
In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, 
participants reaffirmed that they were committed to us-
ing the Federal Reserve’s full range of tools in order to 
support the U.S. economy during this challenging time, 
thereby promoting the Committee’s statutory goals of 
maximum employment and price stability.  They also 
noted that the path of the economy would depend sig-
nificantly on the course of the virus and that the ongoing 
public health crisis would continue to weigh on eco-
nomic activity, employment, and inflation in the near 
term and posed considerable risks to the economic out-
look over the medium term. 

Page 10Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ 
 
 
All participants agreed that the completion of the frame-
work review and the publication of the revised consen-
sus statement provided a strong foundation for mone-
tary policy decisions and communications going for-
ward.  Accordingly, participants agreed that it would be 
appropriate to incorporate some key elements of the re-
vised consensus statement into the FOMC statement to 
be released following this meeting.  In particular, partic-
ipants reiterated their commitment to achieve maximum 
employment and an inflation rate of 2 percent over the 
longer run.  With inflation running persistently below its 
longer-run goal, participants judged that it would be ap-
propriate to aim to achieve inflation moderately above 
2 percent for some time so that inflation would average 
2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expecta-
tions would remain well anchored at 2 percent. 
Against this backdrop, participants discussed a range of 
issues associated with providing greater clarity about the 
likely path of the federal funds rate in the years ahead.  
Most participants supported providing more explicit 
outcome-based forward guidance for the federal funds 
rate that included establishing criteria for lifting the fed-
eral funds rate above the ELB in terms of the paths for 
employment or inflation or both.  Among the partici-
pants who favored providing more explicit forward 
guidance at this meeting, all but a couple supported a 
formulation in which the forward guidance included lan-
guage indicating that it would likely be appropriate to 
maintain the current target range until labor market con-
ditions were judged to be consistent with the Commit-
tee’s assessments of maximum employment and infla-
tion had risen to 2 percent and was on track to moder-
ately exceed 2 percent for some time.  These participants 
noted that communicating that the target range for the 
federal funds rate would remain at the ELB until these 
criteria were achieved would provide appropriately clear 
and strong policy guidance.  Doing so at this meeting 
was viewed as an especially important way of affirming 
the Committee’s commitment to achieving the eco-
nomic outcomes articulated in the consensus statement. 
Participants generally noted that outcome-based for-
ward guidance for the federal funds rate of this type was 
not an unconditional commitment to a particular path.    
Indeed, outcome-based guidance of this type would al-
low the public to infer changes in the Committee’s as-
sessment of how long the target range for the federal 
funds rate would remain at its current setting.  Infor-
mation pointing to a weaker outlook for the economy 
and inflation would tend to lead to public expectations 
for a longer period at the current setting of the target 
range while information suggesting a stronger outlook 

for the economy and inflation would tend to lead to ex-
pectations for a shorter period at the current setting.  In 
addition, circumstances could arise in which the Com-
mittee judged that it would be appropriate to change its 
guidance, particularly if risks emerged that could impede 
the attainment of its economic objectives. 
A couple of participants preferred even stronger, and 
less qualified, outcome-based forward guidance that they 
judged would more clearly convey the Committee’s 
commitment to its objectives and to the strategic ap-
proach that was articulated in the revised consensus 
statement.  In particular, these participants preferred for-
ward guidance in which the target range for the federal 
funds rate remained at the ELB until inflation had 
moved above 2 percent for some time.  Especially in 
light of the lengthy period in which inflation has run be-
low the Committee’s longer-run 2 percent objective, 
these participants judged that it was critical to demon-
strate the Committee’s commitment to achieve out-
comes in which inflation averages 2 percent over time. 
Several participants noted that while they agreed it was 
appropriate to incorporate key elements of the consen-
sus statement into the postmeeting statement, they pre-
ferred to retain forward guidance similar to that pro-
vided in recent FOMC statements.  These participants 
judged that it would likely be appropriate to maintain an 
accommodative stance of policy for some time in order 
to foster outcomes consistent with the Committee’s re-
vised consensus statement.  However, with longer-term 
interest rates already very low, there did not appear to be 
a need for enhanced forward guidance at this juncture or 
much scope for forward guidance to put additional 
downward pressure on yields.  Moreover, these partici-
pants were concerned that forward guidance that in-
volved the target range for the federal funds rate remain-
ing at the ELB until employment and inflation criteria 
were achieved could limit the Committee’s flexibility for 
years.  Furthermore, by influencing expectations for the 
path of short-term interest rates, such guidance could 
contribute to a buildup of financial imbalances that 
would make it more difficult for the Committee to 
achieve its objectives in the future. 
Regarding asset purchases, participants judged that it 
would be appropriate over coming months for the Fed-
eral Reserve to increase its holdings of Treasury securi-
ties and agency MBS at least at the current pace.  These 
actions would continue to help sustain smooth market 
functioning and would continue to help foster accom-
modative financial conditions, thereby supporting the 

Minutes of the Meeting of September 15–16, 2020Page 11_____________________________________________________________________________________________ 
 
 
flow of credit to households and businesses.  Some par-
ticipants also noted that in future meetings it would be 
appropriate to further assess and communicate how the 
Committee’s asset purchase program could best support 
the achievement of 
the Committee’s maximum- 
employment and price-stability goals.  
Participants widely echoed the remarks at the opening of 
the meeting in memory of Thomas Laubach.  Partici-
pants universally recognized his great leadership and in-
tellectual contributions to the work of the Committee as 
well as his warm and generous spirit. 

Committee Policy Action 

In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, 
members agreed that the COVID-19 pandemic was 
causing tremendous human and economic hardship 
across the United States and around the world.  They 
noted that economic activity and employment had 
picked up in recent months but remained well below 
their levels at the beginning of the year, and that weaker 
demand and significantly lower oil prices were holding 
down consumer price inflation.  Overall, financial con-
ditions had improved in recent months, in part reflecting 
policy measures to support the economy and the flow of 
credit to U.S. households and businesses.  Members 
agreed that the Federal Reserve was committed to using 
its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this 
challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum-em-
ployment and price-stability goals. Members also stated 
that the path of the economy would depend significantly 
on the course of the virus.  In addition, members agreed 
that the ongoing public health crisis would continue to 
weigh on economic activity, employment, and inflation 
in the near term and was posing considerable risks to the 
economic outlook over the medium term.  
All members agreed to incorporate into the postmeeting 
statement key elements of the Committee’s revised 
Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy 
Strategy.  Members judged that this action would under-
score the Committee’s strong commitment to the goals 
and strategy articulated in the new consensus statement 
in pursuit of the Committee’s statutory objectives.  Ac-
cordingly, members agreed that the FOMC statement 
should note that the Committee seeks to achieve maxi-
mum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent 
over the longer run and that, with inflation running per-
sistently below this longer-run goal, the Committee will 
aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for 
some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time 
and longer-term inflation expectations remain well an-
chored at 2 percent.  Members generally expected that it 

would be appropriate to maintain an accommodative 
stance of monetary policy until these outcomes were 
achieved. 
All members agreed to maintain the target range for the 
federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent.  Almost all members 
viewed this meeting as the appropriate time to modify 
forward guidance to provide greater clarity regarding the 
likely future path of the federal funds rate.  To this end, 
almost all members agreed on a specification for out-
come-based forward guidance that indicated that the 
Committee expects that it will be appropriate to main-
tain the current setting of the target range for the federal 
funds rate until labor market conditions had reached lev-
els consistent with the Committee’s assessments of max-
imum employment and inflation had risen to 2 percent 
and was on track to run moderately in excess of 2 per-
cent for some time.  Two members dissented from the 
policy decision.  One of these dissenting members pre-
ferred that the Committee retain greater policy rate flex-
ibility by retaining the language in the forward guidance 
provided in the July postmeeting statement; that lan-
guage noted that it would be appropriate to maintain the 
current target range until the Committee was confident 
that the economy had weathered recent events and was 
on track to achieve its maximum employment and price 
stability goals.  The other dissenting member preferred a 
stronger formulation for the forward guidance—one in 
which the Committee would indicate that it expected to 
maintain the current target range until core inflation had 
reached 2 percent on a sustained basis. 
In their discussion of monetary policy for the period 
ahead, members generally agreed that the Committee’s 
policy guidance expressed its assessment about the path 
for the federal funds rate most likely to be consistent 
with achievement of the Committee’s goals, but that it 
was not an unconditional commitment.  They stated that 
the appropriate rate path would depend on the evolution 
of the economic outlook.  Accordingly, they agreed that 
the Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance 
of policy as appropriate in the event that risks emerged 
that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s 
goals.  Members also agreed that, in assessing the appro-
priate stance of monetary policy, they would take into 
account a wide range of information, including readings 
on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pres-
sures and inflation expectations, and financial and inter-
national developments. 
Members noted that the Committee’s asset purchases 
had helped foster significant improvements in market 
functioning over recent months.  In addition, purchases 

Page 12Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ 
 
 
of securities were contributing to accommodative finan-
cial conditions in a way that supported economic recov-
ery.  Consistent with these observations, members 
agreed that it would be appropriate to acknowledge in 
the postmeeting statement the role of asset purchases in 
supporting accommodative financial conditions.  The 
Committee’s statement thus indicated that over coming 
months it would be appropriate for the Federal Reserve 
to increase its holdings of Treasury securities and agency 
MBS at least at the current pace to sustain smooth mar-
ket functioning and to help foster accommodative finan-
cial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to 
households and businesses.   
Members considered the staff proposal to eliminate the 
requirement in the directive to increase the holdings of 
agency CMBS in the SOMA portfolio.  In light of the 
substantial improvement in market functioning in the 
agency CMBS market, the Committee judged that it 
would be appropriate for the Desk to purchase agency 
CMBS only as needed to sustain smooth market func-
tioning, rather than seek to steadily increase agency 
CMBS holdings, and to cease reinvestments of agency 
CMBS principal payments.  Members also concluded 
that, in light of ongoing low take-up at Desk repo oper-
ations, it was not necessary to include a sentence on 
these operations in the FOMC statement.  However, the 
directive adopted by the Committee continued to direct 
the Desk to conduct overnight and term repo operations 
to support effective policy implementation and smooth 
functioning of short-term U.S. dollar funding markets. 
At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee 
voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank 
of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute 
transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the fol-
lowing domestic policy directive, for release at 2:00 p.m.: 
“Effective September 17, 2020, the Federal 
Open Market Committee directs the Desk to:  
• Undertake open market operations as nec-
essary to maintain the federal funds rate in 
a target range of 0 to ¼ percent. 
Increase the System Open Market Ac-
count holdings of Treasury securities and 
agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) 
at the current pace. Increase holdings of 
Treasury securities and agency MBS by ad-
ditional amounts and purchase agency 
commercial mortgage-backed securities 
(CMBS) as needed to sustain smooth func-
tioning of markets for these securities. 

• 

• Conduct term and overnight repurchase 
agreement operations to support effective 
policy implementation and the smooth 
functioning of short-term U.S. dollar 
funding markets. 
• Conduct overnight reverse repurchase 
agreement operations at an offering rate of 
0.00 percent and with a per-counterparty 
limit of $30 billion per day; the per-coun-
terparty limit can be temporarily increased 
at the discretion of the Chair. 
• Roll over at auction all principal payments 
from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of 
Treasury securities and reinvest all princi-
pal payments from the Federal Reserve’s 
holdings of agency debt and agency MBS 
in agency MBS. 
• Allow modest deviations from stated 
amounts for purchases and reinvestments, 
if needed for operational reasons. 
• Engage in dollar roll and coupon swap 
transactions as necessary to facilitate set-
tlement of the Federal Reserve’s agency 
MBS transactions.” 
The vote also encompassed approval of the statement 
below for release at 2:00 p.m.: 
“The Federal Reserve is committed to using its 
full range of tools to support the U.S. economy 
in this challenging time, thereby promoting its 
maximum employment and price stability goals. 
The COVID-19 pandemic is causing tremen-
dous human and economic hardship across the 
United States and around the world.  Economic 
activity and employment have picked up in re-
cent months but remain well below their levels 
at the beginning of the year.  Weaker demand 
and significantly lower oil prices are holding 
down consumer price inflation.  Overall finan-
cial conditions have improved in recent months, 
in part reflecting policy measures to support the 
economy and the flow of credit to U.S. house-
holds and businesses. 
The path of the economy will depend signifi-
cantly on the course of the virus.  The ongoing 
public health crisis will continue to weigh on 
economic activity, employment, and inflation in 
the near term, and poses considerable risks to 
the economic outlook over the medium term. 

Minutes of the Meeting of September 15–16, 2020Page 13_____________________________________________________________________________________________ 
 
 
The Committee seeks to achieve maximum em-
ployment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent 
over the longer run.  With inflation running per-
sistently below this longer-run goal, the Com-
mittee will aim to achieve inflation moderately 
above 2 percent for some time so that inflation 
averages 2 percent over time and longer-term 
inflation expectations remain well anchored at 
2 percent.  The Committee expects to maintain 
an accommodative stance of monetary policy 
until these outcomes are achieved.  The Com-
mittee decided to keep the target range for the 
federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and expects 
it will be appropriate to maintain this target 
range until 
labor market conditions have 
reached levels consistent with the Committee’s 
assessments of maximum employment and in-
flation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to 
moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.  In 
addition, over coming months the Federal Re-
serve will increase its holdings of Treasury secu-
rities and agency mortgage-backed securities at 
least at the current pace to sustain smooth mar-
ket functioning and help foster accommodative 
financial conditions, thereby supporting the 
flow of credit to households and businesses. 
In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary 
policy, the Committee will continue to monitor 
the implications of incoming information for 
the economic outlook.  The Committee would 
be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary 
policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could 
impede the attainment of the Committee’s 
goals.  The Committee’s assessments will take 
into account a wide range of information, in-
cluding readings on public health, labor market 
conditions, inflation pressures and inflation ex-
pectations, and financial and international de-
velopments.” 
Voting for this action:  Jerome H. Powell, John C. 
Williams, Michelle W. Bowman, Lael Brainard, Richard 
H. Clarida, Patrick Harker, Loretta J. Mester, and Randal 
K. Quarles.

Voting against this action:  Robert S. Kaplan and Neel 

Kashkari. 
President Kaplan dissented because he expects that it 
will be appropriate to maintain the current target range 
until the Committee is confident that the economy has 
weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its 
maximum employment and price stability goals as artic-
ulated in its new policy strategy statement, but prefers 
that the Committee retain greater policy rate flexibility 
beyond that point.  President Kashkari dissented be-
cause he prefers that the Committee indicate that it ex-
pects to maintain the current target range until core in-
flation has reached 2 percent on a sustained basis. 
Consistent with the Committee’s decision to leave the 
target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the 
Board of Governors voted unanimously to leave the in-
terest rates on required and excess reserve balances at 
0.10 percent.  The Board of Governors also voted unan-
imously to approve establishment of the primary credit 
rate at the existing level of 0.25 percent, effective Sep-
tember 17, 2020. 
It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee 
would be held on Wednesday–Thursday, November 4–
5, 2020.  The meeting adjourned at 11:00 a.m. on Sep-
tember 16, 2020. 

Notation Votes  

By notation vote completed on August 18, 2020, the 
Committee unanimously approved the minutes of the 
Committee meeting held on July 28–29, 2020. 
By notation vote completed on August 27, 2020, the 
Committee unanimously approved updates to its State-
ment on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strat-
egy.  In conjunction with the notation vote, all non- 
voting participants also expressed support for the up-
dated statement.

Summary of Economic Projections 

In conjunction with the Federal Open Market Commit-
tee (FOMC) meeting held on September 15–16, 2020, 
meeting participants submitted their projections of the 
most likely outcomes for real gross domestic product 
(GDP) growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for 
each year from 2020 to 2023 and over the longer run.  
Each participant’s projections were based on infor-
mation available at the time of the meeting, together with 
her or his assessment of appropriate monetary policy—
including a path for the federal funds rate and its longer-
run value—and assumptions about other factors likely 
to affect economic outcomes.  The longer-run projec-
tions represent each participant’s assessment of the 
value to which each variable would be expected to con-
verge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and 
in the absence of further shocks to the economy. 1  “Ap-
propriate monetary policy” is defined as the future path 
of policy that each participant deems most likely to fos-
ter outcomes for economic activity and inflation that 
best satisfy his or her individual interpretation of the 
statutory mandate to promote maximum employment 
and price stability. 
The current projections for real activity, the labor mar-
ket, and inflation were notably stronger than the projec-
tions in the June 2020 Summary of Economic Projec-
tions (SEP) for the overlapping years from 2020 to 2022.  
Participants revised up their economic outlook in light 
of the stronger-than-expected rebound in economic ac-
tivity over recent months, although they noted that they 
remained attentive to the effects of the COVID-19 pan-
demic and the measures taken to contain it.  Table 1 and 
figure 1 provide summary statistics for the projections.  
Almost all participants projected that real GDP will con-
tract in 2020, with the median participant seeing a milder 
contraction relative to the median projection in the June 
SEP.  Additionally, almost all participants projected that 
real GDP would grow faster than their estimates of its 
longer-run normal growth rate from 2021 to 2023.  All 
participants projected that the unemployment rate in the 
final quarter of 2020 would be notably lower than they 
had projected in June and that the unemployment rate 
would decline gradually during the forecast period.  Most 
participants expected that a full economic recovery 
would take some time, and many projected that the un-
employment rate in the final quarter of 2023 would be

rate. 

slightly below its estimated longer-run level.  A vast ma-
jority of participants projected that total inflation, as 
measured by the four-quarter percent change in the price 
index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), 
would be at or below the FOMC’s 2 percent longer-run 
inflation objective throughout the forecast period.  Pro-
jections for core PCE price inflation, which excludes 
consumer food and energy prices, generally followed a 
similar trajectory.   
As shown in figure 2, most participants indicated that 
their expectations regarding the evolution of the econ-
omy, 
relative 
to 
the Committee’s maximum- 
employment and price-stability objectives, would likely 
warrant keeping the federal funds rate at its current level 
through at least the end of 2023.  The median of partic-
ipants’ assessments of the longer-run level for the federal 
funds rate was unchanged from its value in the June 
SEP. 
Amid uncertainty about the course of the pandemic and 
its effects on the economy, all participants continued to 
regard the uncertainties surrounding the economic out-
look as higher than the average over the past 20 years.  
In addition, a substantial majority of participants as-
sessed the risks to their outlook for real GDP growth as 
weighted to the downside and the risks to their unem-
ployment rate projections as weighted to the upside.  
The risks to inflation projections were judged as 
weighted to the downside by a substantial majority of 
participants.  

The Outlook for Real GDP Growth and the Unem-
ployment Rate 

As shown in figure 3.A, almost all participants continued 
to project that real GDP would decline in 2020, with the 
median projection anticipating a decrease of 3.7 percent.  
Nevertheless, 
these projections were substantially 
stronger than those from the June SEP, when the me-
dian participant expected real GDP to contract 6.5 per-
cent.  These revisions, in part, reflect the stronger-than-
expected incoming data since June.  Almost all partici-
pants expected that the rate of real GDP growth from 
2021 to 2023 would be above their estimates of its 
longer-run pace, with the median projections being 
4.0 percent, 3.0 percent, and 2.5 percent in these years, 
respectively.  The distribution of estimates of real GDP

Note: Projections of change in real gross domestic product (GDP) and projections for both measures of inﬂation are percent changes from the fourth quarter of
the previous year to the fourth quarter of the year indicated. PCE inﬂation and core PCE inﬂation are the percentage rates of change in, respectively, the price index
for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and the price index for PCE excluding food and energy. Projections for the unemployment rate are for the average
civilian unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of the year indicated. Each participant’s projections are based on his or her assessment of appropriate monetary
policy. Longer-run projections represent each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge under appropriate monetary
policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. The projections for the federal funds rate are the value of the midpoint of the projected appropriate
target range for the federal funds rate or the projected appropriate target level for the federal funds rate at the end of the speciﬁed calendar year or over the longer
run. The June projections were made in conjunction with the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on June 9–10, 2020. One participant did not submit
longer-run projections for the change in real GDP, the unemployment rate, or the federal funds rate in conjunction with the June 9–10, 2020, meeting, and one
participant did not submit such projections in conjunction with the September 15–16, 2020, meeting.
1. For each period, the median is the middle projection when the projections are arranged from lowest to highest. When the number of projections is even, the
median is the average of the two middle projections.
2. The central tendency excludes the three highest and three lowest projections for each variable in each year.
3. The range for a variable in a given year includes all participants’ projections, from lowest to highest, for that variable in that year.
4. Longer-run projections for core PCE inﬂation are not collected.

June SEP, although the median projection ticked up to 
1.9 percent.   
Reflecting better-than-expected incoming data since 
June, participants revised down their projections for the 
unemployment rate considerably through 2022, the fore-
cast period in the June SEP (figure 3.B).  The projections 
for the unemployment rate in the final quarter of this 
year ranged from 6.5 to 8.0 percent, with a median of 
7.6 percent, and the ranges for projections from 2020 to 
2022 all narrowed considerably since June.  The median 
projected levels of the unemployment rate in the final 
quarters of 2021 and 2022—at 5.5 percent and 4.6 per-
cent, respectively—were above the median estimate of 
the longer-run normal rate of unemployment of 4.1 per-
cent.  However, the median projection of the unemploy-
ment rate in the final quarter of 2023, at 4.0 percent, was 
slightly below the median estimate of its longer-run 
value. 
The distribution of estimates for the longer-run unem-
ployment rate was unchanged from the June SEP.  Many 
participants indicated that they were still assessing 
whether the sharp contraction in economic activity dur-
ing the first half of this year was likely to leave a lasting 
imprint on the labor market or the productive capacity 
of the economy. 

The Outlook for Inflation 

As shown in figures 3.C and 3.D, almost all participants 
revised up their projections for inflation in 2020 relative 
to their June projections, with the median projections 
for total and core inflation at 1.2 percent and 1.5 percent, 
respectively.  Most participants expected inflation to rise 
over the next three years, although about half of them 
expected PCE price inflation to still fall short of the 
Committee’s longer-run 2 percent inflation objective by 
the end of the forecast horizon.  A few participants pro-
jected inflation to move above 2 percent before return-
ing to 2 percent by 2023.  A few participants expected 
inflation to move above its longer-run level in 2023, and 
several participants mentioned that they would expect 
inflation to rise above 2 percent in the years after.  

Appropriate Monetary Policy 

As shown in figure 3.E, most participants projected that 
it would be appropriate to maintain the target range for 
the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent through at least 
the end of 2023.  Most participants noted that their as-
sessment of appropriate monetary policy took into ac-
count the new Statement on Longer-Run Goals and 
Monetary Policy Strategy.  In particular, because infla-
tion has been running persistently below 2 percent, par-
ticipants mentioned that they linked their assessment of 
the appropriate path of the federal funds rate to their 
assessment of shortfalls of employment from the Com-
mittee’s maximum-employment objective and to a mod-
erate rise in inflation above 2 percent to help anchor in-
flation expectations at the Committee’s 2 percent longer-
run goal.  The median of participants’ estimates of the 
longer-run level of the federal funds rate was unchanged 
from June at 2.50 percent. 

Uncertainty and Risks 

In assessing the appropriate path for monetary policy, 
FOMC participants take account of the range of possible 
economic outcomes, the likelihood of those outcomes, 
and the potential benefits and costs should they occur.  
As shown in the panels on the left side of figure 4, almost 
all participants continued to view the current uncertainty 
surrounding each of the four economic variables—real 
GDP growth, the unemployment rate, total PCE infla-
tion, and core PCE inflation—as being greater than the 
average over the past 20 years. 2  
A substantial majority of participants judged the risks to 
their projections for real GDP growth as weighted to the 
downside and the risks to their unemployment rate pro-
jections as weighted to the upside (figure 4).  A substan-
tial majority of participants viewed the risks to their in-
flation projections as weighted to the downside. 
In discussing the uncertainty and risks surrounding their 
economic projections, the course of the pandemic con-
tinued to be mentioned as a key source of uncertainty.  
The possibility of another wave of contagion and delays 
in developing a vaccine were seen as potential downside 
risks to the economic outlook.  As for upside risks, par-
ticipants   mentioned   the   possibility   of   faster-than- 

2 As a reference, table 2 provides estimates of the forecast un-
certainty for the change in real GDP, the unemployment rate, 
and total consumer price inflation over the period from 2000 
through 2019.  At the end of this summary, the box “Forecast 
Uncertainty” discusses the sources and interpretation of un-
certainty in the economic forecasts and explains the approach 
used to assess the uncertainty and risks attending participants’ 
projections.  

Previous SEP addendums to the FOMC minutes contained 
figures showing the median projections along with confidence 
intervals based on historical forecast errors.  As the level of 
uncertainty about the economic outlook is currently judged to 
be higher than its historical average because of uncertainty 
about the course of the coronavirus and its effects on the 
economy, these “fan charts” have been omitted from this ad-
dendum.

NOTE:  Error ranges shown are measured as plus or minus the 
root mean squared error of projections for 2000 through 2019 that 
were released in the fall by various private and government forecasters.  
As described in the box “Forecast Uncertainty,” under certain assump-
tions, there is about a 70 percent probability that actual outcomes for 
real GDP, unemployment, consumer prices, and the federal funds rate 
will be in ranges implied by the average size of projection errors made 
in the past.  For more information, see David Reifschneider and Peter 
Tulip (2017), “Gauging the Uncertainty of the Economic Outlook Us-
ing Historical Forecasting Errors:  The Federal Reserve’s Approach,”

anticipated progress in dealing with the disease and bet-
ter-targeted measures in responding to the virus.  Partic-
ipants also pointed to a number of other risks, including 

the extent and timing of additional fiscal support, the 
magnitude of supply-side disruptions associated with 
postponements of in-class school openings and small 
business closings, the likelihood of elevated levels of 
business bankruptcies, and credit quality problems that 
could potentially curtail lending.  Several participants 
also expressed concerns about global geopolitical devel-
opments and related tensions as well as prolonged reces-
sionary dynamics such as labor market scarring or infla-
tion persistently undershooting the Committee’s longer-
run goal.  
Participants’ assessments of the appropriate future path 
of the federal funds rate are also subject to considerable 
uncertainty.  Because the Committee adjusts monetary 
policy in response to actual and prospective develop-
ments over time in key economic variables—such as real 
GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation—
uncertainty surrounding the projected path for the fed-
eral funds rate importantly reflects the uncertainties 
about the paths for these economic variables, along with 
other factors.  As with the macroeconomic variables, the 
forecast uncertainty surrounding the appropriate path of 
the federal funds rate is substantial.

Forecast Uncertainty 

The economic projections provided by the 
members of the Board of Governors and the presi-
dents of the Federal Reserve Banks inform discus-
sions of monetary policy among policymakers and 
can aid public understanding of the basis for policy 
actions.  Considerable uncertainty attends these 
projections, however.  The economic and statistical 
models and relationships used to help produce eco-
nomic forecasts are necessarily imperfect descrip-
tions of the real world, and the future path of the 
economy can be affected by myriad unforeseen de-
velopments and events.  Thus, in setting the stance 
of monetary policy, participants consider not only 
what appears to be the most likely economic out-
come as embodied in their projections, but also the 
range of alternative possibilities, the likelihood of 
their occurring, and the potential costs to the econ-
omy should they occur. 
Table 2 summarizes the average historical accu-
racy of a range of forecasts, including those re-
ported in past Monetary Policy Reports and those pre-
pared by the Federal Reserve Board’s staff in ad-
vance of meetings of the Federal Open Market 
Committee.  The projection error ranges shown in 
the table illustrate the considerable uncertainty as-
sociated with economic forecasts.  For example, 
suppose a participant projects that real gross do-
mestic product (GDP) and total consumer prices 
will rise steadily at annual rates of, respectively, 
3 percent and 2 percent.  If the uncertainty attend-
ing those projections is similar to that experienced 
in the past and the risks around the projections are 
broadly balanced, the numbers reported in table 2 
would imply a probability of about 70 percent that 
actual GDP would expand within a range of 1.9 to 
4.1 percent in the current year, 1.3 to 4.7 percent in 
the second year, 1.2 to 4.8 percent in the third year, 
and 1.1 to 4.9 percent in the fourth year.  The cor-
responding 70 percent confidence intervals for 
overall inflation would be 1.2 to 2.8 percent in the 
current year, 1.0 to 3.0 percent in the second year, 
0.9 to 3.1 percent in the third year, and 1.0 to 
3.0 percent in the fourth year.  

Because current conditions may differ from those 
that prevailed, on average, over history, participants 
provide judgments as to whether the uncertainty at-
tached to their projections of each economic variable 
is greater than, smaller than, or broadly similar to typ-
ical levels of forecast uncertainty seen in the past 
20 years, as presented in table 2. 
That is, participants judge whether each eco-
nomic variable is more likely to be above or below 
their projections of the most likely outcome.  These 
judgments about the uncertainty and the risks attend-
ing each participant’s projections are distinct from the 
diversity of participants’ views about the most likely 
outcomes.  Forecast uncertainty is concerned with the 
risks associated with a particular projection rather 
than with divergences across a number of different 
projections.  As with real activity and inflation, the 
outlook for the future path of the federal funds rate 
is subject to considerable uncertainty.  This uncer-
tainty arises primarily because each participant’s as-
sessment of the appropriate stance of monetary policy 
depends importantly on the evolution of real activity 
and inflation over time.  If economic conditions 
evolve in an unexpected manner, then assessments of 
the appropriate setting of the federal funds rate would 
change from that point forward.  The final line in ta-
ble 2 shows the error ranges for forecasts of short-
term interest rates.  They suggest that the historical 
confidence intervals associated with projections of 
the federal funds rate are quite wide.  It should be 
noted, however, that these confidence intervals are 
not strictly consistent with the projections for the fed-
eral funds rate, as these projections are not forecasts 
of the most likely quarterly outcomes but rather are 
projections of participants’ individual assessments of 
appropriate monetary policy and are on an end-of-
year basis.  However, the forecast errors should pro-
vide a sense of the uncertainty around the future path 
of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty 
about the macroeconomic variables as well as addi-
tional adjustments to monetary policy that would be 
appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the 
economy.
