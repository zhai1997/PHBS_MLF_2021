Developments in Financial Markets and Open Mar-
ket Operations 

The System Open Market Account (SOMA) manager 
first discussed developments in financial markets.  Fi-
nancial conditions were little changed, on net, over the 
intermeeting period and remained accommodative.  
Market participants suggested that evolving expectations 
for U.S. fiscal policy as well as stronger-than-expected 
economic data and corporate earnings reports helped 
support equity prices.  Later in the intermeeting period, 
however, rising COVID-19 cases in Europe and the 
United States weighed on the outlook, and equity prices 
reversed some of their earlier gains.  Implied volatility in 
the equity market moved higher during the intermeeting 
period, reflecting uncertainties associated with the U.S. 
election and the future path of fiscal policy as well as 
concerns about the trajectory of COVID-19 cases.   
Market participants’ expectations for the path of the fed-
eral funds rate were little changed over the intermeeting 
period.  In the Open Market Desk’s Survey of Primary 
Dealers and Survey of Market Participants, respondents’ 
views on when the Committee will most likely start rais-
ing the target range for the federal funds rate were cen-
tered around 2024.  Expectations for the economic con-
ditions that will prevail when the FOMC first lifts the 
target range were little changed since the September sur-
veys.   
Respondents to the Desk’s surveys generally expected 
the Federal Reserve’s purchases of Treasury securities 
and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) to con-
tinue at the current pace through the end of 2021 and 
then to slow in subsequent years, although there was a 
wide range of views about purchase amounts for 2022 
and 2023.  Market participants appeared increasingly fo-
cused on how the Committee’s communications on as-
set purchases might evolve.  They expected those com-
munications to place a greater emphasis on fostering ac-
commodative financial conditions, and many noted the 
possibility that at some point the Committee might con-
vey additional guidance about the future path of asset 
purchases.  Some market participants expected the Com-
mittee to eventually lengthen the weighted average ma-
turity of the Federal Reserve’s purchases of Treasury se-
curities.

The manager turned next to a discussion of financial 
market functioning, open market operations, and condi-
tions in short-term funding markets.  Markets for Treas-
ury securities and agency MBS continued to function 
smoothly, with bid-ask spreads and a range of other mar-
ket functioning indicators remaining near pre-pandemic 
levels.  Weekly operations continued for agency com-
mercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS), with the 
Desk purchasing only modest amounts.  Short-term dol-
lar funding markets also continued to function smoothly 
over the period, and forward measures of funding rates 
were consistent with expectations for calm conditions 
over year-end. 
The Federal Reserve’s balance sheet increased modestly 
over the intermeeting period to $7.2 trillion, as growth 
in securities holdings was partially offset by a decline in 
U.S. dollar liquidity swaps outstanding.  Outstanding 
balances for credit and liquidity facilities were little 
changed.  The manager noted that market participants 
continued to view these facilities as important backstops 
that would support market functioning and the flow of 
credit should stresses reemerge.   
By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s 
domestic transactions over the intermeeting period.  
There were no intervention operations in foreign curren-
cies for the System’s account during the intermeeting pe-
riod.  

Discussion on Asset Purchases 

Participants discussed the FOMC’s asset purchases, in-
cluding the role they are playing in supporting the Com-
mittee’s maximum-employment and price-stability goals.  
In their discussions, participants focused on the objec-
tives of these purchases; considerations for assessing the 
appropriate pace and composition of asset purchases 
over time; communications regarding the future path of 
asset purchases; and the potential effects of higher levels 
of reserves, associated with the ongoing expansion in 
Federal Reserve asset holdings, on banks’ balance sheets 
and money market rates.  Participants agreed that this 
discussion would be helpful for future assessments of 
the appropriate structure of the Committee’s asset pur-
chases.  While participants judged that immediate adjust-
ments to the pace and composition of asset purchases 
were not necessary, they recognized that circumstances 
could shift to warrant such adjustments.  Accordingly, 
participants saw the ongoing careful consideration of 
potential next steps for enhancing the Committee’s guid-
ance for its asset purchases as appropriate. 

The participants’ discussion was preceded by staff 
presentations.  The staff reviewed some key considera-
tions relevant for conducting asset purchases in the cur-
rent environment.  The staff judged that the Commit-
tee’s forward guidance on the federal funds rate, the ex-
pansion of the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings 
since March, and expectations for a further expansion all 
had contributed to a very low level of longer-term yields 
despite substantial Treasury debt issuance.  The staff 
noted that financial market participants generally ex-
pected the Committee to continue its net asset purchases 
at the current pace through next year and at a reduced 
pace in subsequent years.  The staff discussed various 
changes the Committee could make to the structure of 
its purchases, including to their pace and composition as 
well as to the guidance the Committee has been provid-
ing to the public about its future asset purchases.  The 
staff discussed the structure of asset purchase programs 
of several foreign central banks and how they have 
evolved during the pandemic.  Finally, the staff evaluated 
how higher levels of reserves associated with the ongo-
ing expansion in the Federal Reserve’s asset holdings 
might influence banks’ balance sheets and money market 
rates and discussed the various tools that the Federal Re-
serve has for managing money market rates in an envi-
ronment with very high levels of reserves.   
In their discussion regarding the role of the Committee’s 
asset purchases, participants noted that these purchases 
have supported and sustained smooth market function-
ing and helped foster accommodative financial condi-
tions.  With market functioning seen as having largely 
recovered, many participants indicated that the role of 
asset purchases had shifted more toward fostering ac-
commodative financial conditions for households and 
businesses to support the Committee’s employment and 
inflation goals.  Still, participants generally judged that 
asset purchases would continue to support smooth mar-
ket functioning, and many judged that asset purchases 
helped provide insurance against risks that might 
reemerge in financial markets in an environment of high 
uncertainty.  A few participants indicated that asset pur-
chases could also help guard against undesirable upward 
pressure on longer-term rates that could arise, for exam-
ple, from higher-than-expected Treasury debt issuance.  
Several participants noted the possibility that there may 
be limits to the amount of additional accommodation 
that could be provided through increases in the Federal 
Reserve’s asset holdings in light of the low level of 
longer-term yields, and they expressed concerns that a 
significant expansion in asset holdings could have unin-
tended consequences.   

_____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of November 4–5, 2020Page 3Participants commented on considerations related to the 
appropriate pace and composition of asset purchases.  
Participants generally saw the current pace and compo-
sition as effective in fostering accommodative financial 
conditions.  Participants noted that the Committee could 
provide more accommodation, if appropriate, by in-
creasing the pace of purchases or by shifting its Treasury 
purchases to those with a longer maturity without in-
creasing the size of its purchases.  Alternatively, the 
Committee could provide more accommodation, if ap-
propriate, by conducting purchases of the same pace and 
composition over a longer horizon.  Pointing to the re-
cently announced change in the Bank of Canada’s asset 
purchase program, several participants judged that the 
Committee could maintain its current degree of accom-
modation by lengthening the maturity of the Commit-
tee’s Treasury purchases while reducing the pace of pur-
chases somewhat.  In their view, such a change in the 
Committee’s purchase structure would have to be care-
fully communicated to the public to avoid the misper-
ception that the reduced pace of purchases represented 
a decline in the degree of accommodation.  A few par-
ticipants expressed concern that maintaining the current 
pace of agency MBS purchases could contribute to po-
tential valuation pressures in housing markets. 
The September FOMC statement indicated that asset 
purchases will continue “over coming months,” and par-
ticipants viewed this guidance for asset purchases as hav-
ing served the Committee well so far.  Most participants 
judged that the Committee should update this guidance 
at some point and implement qualitative outcome-based 
guidance that links the horizon over which the Commit-
tee anticipates it would be conducting asset purchases to 
economic conditions.  These participants indicated that 
updating the Committee’s guidance for asset purchases 
in this manner would help keep the market’s expectation 
for future asset purchases aligned with the Committee’s 
intentions.  Some of these participants also saw such up-
dated guidance as reinforcing the Committee’s commit-
ment to fostering outcomes consistent with maximum 
employment and inflation that averages 2 percent over 
time.  A few participants were hesitant to make changes 
in the near term to the guidance for asset purchases and 
pointed to considerable uncertainty about the economic 
outlook and the appropriate use of balance sheet policies 
given that uncertainty.   
Participants noted that it would be important for the 
Committee’s guidance for future asset purchases to be 
consistent with the Committee’s forward guidance for 
the federal funds rate so that the use of these tools would 

be well coordinated in terms of achieving the Commit-
tee’s objectives.  Most participants judged that the guid-
ance for asset purchases should imply that increases in 
the Committee’s securities holdings would taper and 
cease sometime before the Committee would begin to 
raise the target range for the federal funds rate.  A num-
ber of participants highlighted the view that after net 
purchases cease there would likely be a period of time in 
which maturing assets would be reinvested to roughly 
maintain the size of the Federal Reserve’s securities 
holdings.   
Participants commented on how a higher level of re-
serves associated with the expansion in the Federal Re-
serve’s asset holdings might affect the banking sector 
and money markets.  A few participants raised concerns 
about the possibility that much higher levels of reserves 
might create pressure on banks’ balance sheets, includ-
ing on regulatory ratios, or could potentially put undue 
downward pressure on money market rates.  Most par-
ticipants judged that the Federal Reserve had effective 
tools to address these circumstances.  Some participants 
noted that, if needed, the Federal Reserve could consider 
various steps to manage the levels of short-term interest 
rates and the quantity of reserves, such as adjusting ad-
ministered rates, expanding the overnight reverse repur-
chase agreement program, or implementing a maturity 
extension program.     

Staff Review of the Economic Situation  

The coronavirus pandemic and the measures undertaken 
to contain its spread continued to affect economic 
activity 
in the United States and abroad. 
 The 
information available at the time of the November 4–5 
meeting suggested that U.S. real gross domestic product 
(GDP) had rebounded at a rapid rate in the third quarter 
but remained well below its level at the start of the year.  
Labor market conditions 
improved 
further 
in 
September, although the pace of gains eased and 
employment continued to be well below its level at the 
beginning of the year.  Consumer price inflation—as 
measured by the 12-month percentage change in the 
price index for personal consumption expenditures 
(PCE) through September—had returned to its year-
earlier pace but remained noticeably below the rates that 
were posted in January and February. 
Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded strongly in 
September, but the gain was markedly below the even 
larger increases seen in previous months.  Through Sep-
tember, payroll employment had retraced only about 
half of the decline seen at the onset of the pandemic.  

Page 4Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________The unemployment rate moved down further to 7.9 per-
cent in September.  The unemployment rates for African 
Americans and Asians both decreased, but the unem-
ployment rate for Hispanics was little changed, and each 
group’s rate remained well above the national average.  
In addition, the overall labor force participation rate de-
clined, and the employment-to-population ratio rose 
only slightly.  Initial claims for unemployment insurance 
continued to move lower, on net, through late October, 
and weekly estimates of private-sector payrolls con-
structed by the Board’s staff using data provided by the 
payroll processor ADP suggested that employment gains 
from mid-September to mid-October remained solid.  
The employment cost index (ECI) for total hourly labor 
compensation in the private sector, which likely had 
been less influenced than other hourly compensation 
measures by the concentration of recent job losses 
among lower-wage workers, rose 2.4 percent over the 
12 months ending in September.  This gain was a little 
smaller than the index’s year-earlier 12-month change; in 
addition, the 3-month changes in the ECI in June and 
September were noticeably below the average pace seen 
over the period from 2017 through 2019. 
Total PCE price inflation was 1.4 percent over the 
12 months ending in September and continued to be 
held down by relatively weak aggregate demand and the 
declines in consumer energy prices seen earlier in the 
year.  Core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes 
in consumer energy prices and many consumer food 
prices, was 1.5 percent over the same period, while the 
trimmed mean measure of 12-month PCE price infla-
tion constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas 
was 1.9 percent in September.  On a monthly basis, in-
flation was a little lower in September, largely reflecting 
slower goods price inflation.  The latest readings on sur-
vey-based measures of longer-run inflation expectations 
moved lower, though each remained within the range in 
which it has fluctuated in recent years; in October, the 
University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers measure 
for the next 5 to 10 years fell back to the level that pre-
vailed in early 2020, while in September the 3-year-ahead 
measure from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York 
retraced its August increase. 
Real PCE rose strongly in the third quarter, though the 
increase was not sufficient to return consumer spending 
to its pre-pandemic level.  Real disposable personal in-
come declined, reflecting a large reduction in govern-
ment transfer payments.  As a result, the personal saving 
rate moved sharply lower, though it was still elevated rel-
ative to its 2019 average.  The consumer sentiment 
measures from the Michigan survey and the Conference 

Board had moved higher, on net, since August; although 
both indexes stood above their April troughs, they re-
mained well below their levels at the start of the year. 
Housing-sector activity advanced in the third quarter, 
with real residential investment and home sales both 
moving above their first-quarter levels.  Activity in this 
sector was likely being supported by low interest rates, 
the sector’s ability to adjust business practices in re-
sponse to social distancing, and pent-up demand follow-
ing the widespread shutdowns earlier in the year. 
Business fixed investment expanded strongly, led by an 
outsized increase in third-quarter equipment spending.  
By contrast, spending on nonresidential structures con-
tinued to move lower and was likely restrained by firms’ 
hesitation to commit to projects with lengthy times to 
completion and uncertain future returns as well as by the 
effect of lower oil prices on drilling investment. 
Growth in both total industrial production and manu-
facturing output turned negative in September after hav-
ing slowed markedly in August.  Part of the softness in 
manufacturing production appeared to be attributable to 
pandemic-related delays in the motor vehicle industry’s 
model-year changeover, though subdued foreign de-
mand and weaker demand from domestic energy pro-
ducers were also likely acting to restrain factory output.  
As of September, manufacturing output had recovered 
roughly two-thirds of the drop seen earlier in the year. 
Total real government purchases declined in the third 
quarter.  Federal nondefense purchases fell especially 
sharply, largely reflecting a step-down in lender pro-
cessing fees associated with the Paycheck Protection 
Program (PPP).  In addition, real purchases by state and 
local governments declined further. 
The nominal U.S. international trade deficit narrowed in 
September after widening in August.  Both exports and 
imports continued to rebound from their collapse in the 
first half of the year.  Goods imports fully recovered to 
their January level, with broad-based increases in August 
and September.  In contrast, goods exports by Septem-
ber recovered only two-thirds of their decline since Jan-
uary despite brisk growth in exports of agricultural prod-
ucts and industrial supplies.  Services trade remained de-
pressed, driven by the continued suspension of most in-
ternational travel.  Altogether, net exports made a sub-
stantial negative contribution to real GDP growth in the 
third quarter. 
Economic activity abroad rebounded sharply in the third 
quarter following a rollback of pandemic-related re-
strictions.  GDP levels, however, generally remained well 

_____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of November 4–5, 2020Page 5below their pre-pandemic peaks, with China being a no-
table exception.  Domestic demand supported the re-
covery, and in Asia there was also a strong rebound of 
exports, especially of electronics and, more recently, au-
tos.  Third-quarter growth was particularly rapid in those 
economies that experienced some of the deepest con-
tractions in the second quarter, including France, Italy, 
and Spain among the advanced foreign economies 
(AFEs) and Mexico among the emerging market econo-
mies.  After falling through the end of the summer in 
many countries, inflation rates started to rise over the 
past two months but remained well below rates from 
early in the year. 
The rapid increase over recent weeks of new COVID-19 
cases in several AFEs, especially in Europe, prompted 
governments to reintroduce restrictions to rein in this 
renewed wave of infections.  In late October, the gov-
ernments of several European countries—including 
England, France, and Germany—announced new na-
tionwide restrictions (including the closures of bars and 
restaurants) and, in some cases, restrictions to the mo-
bility of individuals within and across regions.  Still, rel-
ative to the spring, restrictions were noticeably less se-
vere; factories, most businesses, and schools generally 
remained open. 

Staff Review of the Financial Situation 

Financial market sentiment was little changed over the 
intermeeting period against the backdrop of evolving 
U.S. election and fiscal outlooks, as well as rising 
COVID-19 cases in the United States and Europe.  On 
net, the Treasury yield curve steepened modestly, corpo-
rate bond spreads narrowed somewhat, and broad equity 
price indexes increased.  Inflation compensation in-
creased a little further, remaining close to pre-pandemic 
levels.  Financing conditions for businesses with access 
to capital markets and households with high credit 
scores remained generally accommodative, although 
conditions remained tight or tightened somewhat for 
other borrowers. 
Yields on two-year nominal Treasury securities were lit-
tle changed over the intermeeting period, while longer-
term yields increased modestly, on net, reportedly re-
flecting market participants’ reassessments of the elec-
tion outcome and the outlook for fiscal policy.  FOMC 
communications and macroeconomic data releases did 
not elicit material yield reactions.  Measures of inflation 
compensation based on Treasury Inflation-Protected 
Securities (TIPS) edged up, on net, remaining close to 
their pre-pandemic levels.  This development reflected 
in part the recovery of TIPS market liquidity conditions 

from their stressed levels in the spring.  However, both 
the 5-year and 5-to-10-year measures of inflation com-
pensation remained near the lower ends of their histori-
cal ranges. 
The expected path for the federal funds rate over the 
next few years, as implied by a straight read of overnight 
index swap quotes, was little changed, on net, since the 
September FOMC meeting and remained close to the 
effective lower bound (ELB) until the end of 2023.  Sur-
vey-based expectations favored the first increase in the 
federal funds rate to occur in 2024. 
Broad stock price indexes increased, on balance, over 
the intermeeting period amid volatility associated with 
market participants’ reactions to news on the U.S. elec-
tion, the pandemic’s trajectory, and the fiscal policy out-
look.  One-month option-implied volatility on the S&P 
500—the VIX—increased some, on net, after briefly ris-
ing sharply late in the intermeeting period.  Spreads on 
corporate bond yields over comparable-maturity Treas-
ury yields narrowed across the credit spectrum and stood 
somewhat below their historical median levels at the end 
of the intermeeting period. 
Conditions in short-term funding markets remained sta-
ble over the intermeeting period.  Spreads on commer-
cial paper (CP) and negotiable certificates of deposit 
across different tenors were little changed and remained 
at pre-pandemic levels.  The outstanding level of nonfi-
nancial CP continued to move down over the intermeet-
ing period, reportedly driven by issuers’ relatively low 
appetite for CP funding in light of the availability of 
longer-term financing on attractive terms.  September 
quarter-end effects were muted, and there was no credit 
outstanding through the Commercial Paper Funding Fa-
cility by the end of the intermeeting period.  Conditions 
in money market funds (MMFs) were also generally calm 
over the intermeeting period, and net yields of MMFs 
remained stable near historical lows. 
The effective federal funds rate stood at 9 basis points, 
unchanged from the average over the previous inter-
meeting period.  The Secured Overnight Financing Rate 
averaged 8 basis points, edging down from the previous 
intermeeting period amid a modest net decrease in 
Treasury bill issuance.  The amount of Federal Reserve 
repurchase agreements outstanding remained at zero 
over the intermeeting period, as dealers were able to ob-
tain more attractive rates in the private market.  The Fed-
eral Reserve increased holdings of Treasury securities 
and agency MBS at the same pace as over the previous 
intermeeting period. 

Page 6Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________Investor sentiment abroad turned negative over the in-
termeeting period amid rising COVID-19 case counts, 
newly adopted restrictions aimed at containing the 
spread of the virus, and indicators pointing to a slowing 
recovery in several foreign economies, particularly in the 
euro area.  Uncertainty about additional U.S. fiscal stim-
ulus and the outcome of the U.S. presidential election 
also caused some asset price volatility abroad.  On net, 
most foreign equity indexes declined, option-implied 
volatility in the euro area increased a bit, and most AFE 
long-term sovereign yields fell. 
Overall, the broad dollar index was little changed over 
the intermeeting period.  The dollar appreciated mod-
estly against most AFE currencies except the Japanese 
yen and the British pound.  Several Asian currencies, in-
cluding the Chinese renminbi, the South Korean won, 
and the Taiwanese dollar, appreciated against the U.S. 
dollar amid improving growth prospects and low 
COVID-19 case counts.  Most Latin American curren-
cies (especially the Brazilian real) and the Turkish lira de-
preciated against the U.S. dollar on concerns about fiscal 
and political prospects in Latin America and Turkey.   
Financing conditions in capital markets continued to be 
broadly accommodative over the intermeeting period, 
supported by low interest rates and high equity valua-
tions.  With historically low corporate bond yields, gross 
issuance of both investment- and speculative-grade cor-
porate bonds remained solid in September, moderating 
from robust readings in August but staying close to the 
averages seen in recent years.  Most of this issuance was 
reportedly intended to refinance existing debt.  Gross in-
stitutional leveraged loan issuance continued to pick up 
in September but remained below its average pace in 
2019.  Collateralized loan obligation issuance was strong 
in September, likely supporting robust investor demand 
for newly issued leveraged loans in the coming months.    
The credit quality of nonfinancial corporations contin-
ued to show signs of stabilization.  The volume of down-
grades to corporate bonds and leveraged loans fell to 
pre-pandemic levels through September.  Corporate 
bond and leveraged loan defaults were low in August 
and September relative to their elevated readings in July.  
Market indicators of expected corporate bond and lev-
eraged loan defaults remained somewhat elevated at 
above pre-pandemic levels, especially for lower-rated 
leveraged loan issuers.  
Commercial and industrial (C&I) loans on banks’ bal-
ance sheets continued to decline through September, re-
flecting a mix of weak origination activity and the repay-
ment of credit-line draws from earlier in the year.  In the 

October Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank 
Lending Practices (SLOOS), banks reported that stand-
ards for C&I loans continued to tighten during the third 
quarter, although fewer banks reported tightening than 
in previous quarters.  In addition, demand for C&I loans 
reportedly weakened in the third quarter. 
Financing conditions for small businesses remained tight 
as a result of the pandemic.  Small business loan origina-
tions dropped off sharply in August after a temporary 
boost from PPP distributions over the summer.  At the 
same time, small businesses’ liquidity needs were high 
and appeared likely to increase further, with the most re-
cent Census Bureau Small Business Pulse Survey point-
ing to a majority of small businesses having no more 
than two months of cash on hand and many small busi-
nesses anticipating some need for additional financial as-
sistance in the next six months.  However, the uncer-
tainty surrounding earning prospects was reportedly 
making many business owners less willing to take on 
debt at prevailing terms.  Small business loan perfor-
mance generally deteriorated further over the intermeet-
ing period. 
For commercial real estate (CRE) financed through cap-
ital markets, financing conditions remained accommo-
dative over the intermeeting period.  Spreads on agency 
CMBS were narrow, and issuance was very strong in 
September.  Spreads on triple-A non-agency CMBS, 
which were already within their pre-pandemic range in 
August, moved down further in September and early 
October, while non-agency issuance remained relatively 
subdued in September.  In contrast, CRE loan growth at 
banks decelerated in the third quarter, while standards 
for CRE loans tightened further, according to the Octo-
ber SLOOS. 
Financing conditions in the residential mortgage market 
were little changed over the intermeeting period.  Mort-
gage rates remained near historical lows, supporting high 
volumes of both home-purchase and refinancing origi-
nations.  Credit continued to flow to higher-score bor-
rowers meeting standard conforming loan criteria, while 
it remained tight for borrowers with lower credit scores 
and for nonstandard mortgage products.  Residential 
real estate loans on banks’ balance sheets declined, and 
the October SLOOS suggested that lending standards 
tightened for all mortgage types.  Mortgage forbearance 
rates continued their downward trend, and the rate of 
new delinquencies remained low. 
In consumer credit markets, conditions remained ac-
commodative for borrowers with relatively strong credit 

_____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of November 4–5, 2020Page 7scores but continued to be tight for borrowers with sub-
prime credit scores.  Banks in the October SLOOS indi-
cated that standards tightened and demand was little 
changed, on balance, across consumer loan types follow-
ing a sharp contraction in demand in the second quarter.  
Credit card balances continued to decline through the 
third quarter, with gains in balances for account holders 
with prime credit scores offset by declines in those for 
nonprime accounts.  Interest rates on existing accounts 
were little changed and remained below pre-crisis levels, 
while interest rates on new accounts to nonprime bor-
rowers remained elevated.  Auto loan balances increased 
solidly for prime and near-prime borrowers but declined 
for subprime borrowers.  Auto loan interest rates in-
creased but stayed below pre-pandemic levels.  Condi-
tions in the asset-backed securities market remained sta-
ble over the intermeeting period. 
The staff provided an update on its assessment of the 
stability of the financial system.  The staff judged that, 
accounting for low interest rates, asset valuations ap-
peared moderate, with measures of compensation for 
risk generally in the middle of their historical ranges.  
However, uncertainty regarding the pandemic and eco-
nomic outlook has been high, and the risk of sizable de-
clines in asset prices, should adverse shocks materialize, 
has remained significant.  CRE prices had started to de-
cline in some sectors, while market conditions, including 
rising vacancies and declining rents, pointed to a risk of 
further drops, especially in severely affected sectors.  
The staff assessed vulnerabilities associated with house-
hold and business borrowing as notable.  Household fi-
nances had weakened with the economic downturn, and 
some households could find debt levels burdensome go-
ing forward.  Business debt levels were high before the 
pandemic, and the ability of some businesses to service 
these obligations will depend on the course of the eco-
nomic recovery.  The staff assessed vulnerabilities aris-
ing from financial leverage as moderate.  While the bank-
ing sector has been resilient to recent developments, 
banks’ profitability, as well as that of a range of financial 
institutions, could be affected by future losses, the weak-
ening of the economic outlook relative to pre-pandemic 
conditions, and low interest rates.  With regard to fund-
ing risks, the staff highlighted that structural vulnerabili-
ties in markets for short-term funding and corporate 
bonds remained present.  Emergency facilities were 
viewed as critical in restoring market functioning and 
continued to serve as important backstops.  The staff 
also summarized near-term risks to financial stability 

identified in outreach to the public in recent months, in-
cluding concerns associated with the outlook for the 
pandemic and business defaults.  

Staff Economic Outlook 

In the U.S. economic projection prepared by the staff 
for the November FOMC meeting, the rate of real GDP 
growth and the pace of declines in the unemployment 
rate over the second half of this year were similar to 
those 
in the September forecast despite material 
revisions to several assumptions influencing the outlook 
along with incoming data that were, on balance, better 
than expected.  In particular, in the absence of clear 
progress toward an agreement on further fiscal stimulus, 
the staff removed the assumption that an additional 
tranche of fiscal policy support would be enacted.  
Although this lack of additional fiscal support was 
expected to cause significant hardships for a number of 
households, the staff now assessed that the savings 
cushion accumulated by other households would be 
enough to allow total consumption to be largely 
maintained through year-end.  Hence, as in the 
September projection, the staff continued to expect a 
rapid but partial rebound in activity over the second half 
of the year following the unprecedented contraction in 
the spring.  The inflation forecast for the rest of the year 
was revised up slightly in response to incoming readings 
on inflation that were, on balance, higher than expected.  
Nevertheless, inflation was still projected to finish the 
year at a relatively subdued level, reflecting substantial 
margins of slack in labor and product markets and the 
large declines in consumer energy prices seen earlier in 
the year. 
In the staff’s medium-term projection, the assumption 
that significant additional fiscal support would not be 
enacted pointed to a lower trajectory for aggregate 
demand going forward.  However, recent data on tax 
receipts also suggested that the fiscal positions of states 
and localities had deteriorated less than expected, which 
led the staff to boost the projected path of state and local 
government purchases.  Hence, with monetary policy 
assumed 
to 
remain highly accommodative and 
social-distancing measures expected to ease further, the 
staff continued to project that real GDP over the 
medium term would outpace potential, leading to a 
considerable further decline in the unemployment rate.  
The resulting take-up of economic slack was in turn 
expected to cause inflation to increase gradually, and the 
inflation rate was projected to moderately overshoot 
2 percent for some time in the years beyond 2023 as 
monetary policy remained accommodative. 

Page 8Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________The staff continued to observe that the uncertainty 
related to the future course of the pandemic and its 
consequences for the economy was high.  The staff also 
continued to view the risks to the economic outlook as 
tilted to the downside, with the latest data suggesting an 
increased probability of a resurgence in the disease.  

Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the 
Economic Outlook 

Participants noted that the COVID-19 pandemic was 
causing tremendous human and economic hardship 
across the United States and around the world.  Eco-
nomic activity and employment had continued to re-
cover but remained well below their levels at the begin-
ning of the year.  Weaker demand and earlier declines in 
oil prices had been holding down consumer price infla-
tion.  Overall financial conditions remained accommo-
dative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the 
economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and 
businesses.  Participants agreed that the path of the 
economy would depend on the course of the virus and 
that the ongoing public health crisis would continue to 
weigh on economic activity, employment, and inflation 
in the near term and posed considerable risks to the 
economy’s medium-term outlook. 
Participants observed that the economy had registered a 
rapid though incomplete rebound, with third-quarter 
real GDP rising at an annual rate of 33 percent, reflect-
ing gains across consumer spending, housing-sector ac-
tivity, and business equipment investment.  In recent 
months, however, the pace of improvement had moder-
ated, with slower growth expected for the fourth quarter.  
Participants noted that economic activity thus far had re-
covered faster than had been expected earlier in the year.  
Household spending on goods, especially durable goods, 
had been strong and had moved above its pre-pandemic 
level.  Participants commented that the rebound in con-
sumer spending was due in part to federal stimulus pay-
ments and expanded unemployment benefits, which 
provided essential support to many households.  Partic-
ipants viewed accommodative monetary policy as also 
contributing to gains in durable goods and residential in-
vestment as well as the surge in home sales.  In contrast, 
participants noted that consumer outlays for services 
were increasing more slowly than for durable goods, par-
ticularly for items such as air travel, hotel accommoda-
tions, and restaurant meals, which had been significantly 
disrupted by voluntary and mandated social-distancing 
measures.  Participants generally expected the strength 
in household spending to continue, especially for dura-
ble goods and residential investment.  A few participants 

noted that households’ balance sheets generally ap-
peared healthy and an unwinding of the large pool of 
household savings accumulated during the pandemic 
could provide greater-than-anticipated momentum to 
consumer spending over coming months.  However, 
several participants expressed concern that, in the ab-
sence of additional fiscal support, lower- and moderate-
income households might need to reduce their spending 
sharply when their savings were exhausted.  A couple of 
these participants noted reports from their banking con-
tacts that households appeared to be rapidly exhausting 
funds they received from fiscal relief programs.   
Participants noted that business equipment investment 
had also picked up.  A few participants expected the mo-
mentum in investment to extend into next year as the 
economic recovery continued, while a couple of other 
participants noted that many businesses in their Districts 
were deferring longer-term commitments because of 
heighted uncertainty about the economic outlook.  The 
recovery was viewed as unevenly distributed across in-
dustries.  While many business contacts, particularly 
those in the durable goods or housing industries, re-
ported progress in adapting to the pandemic or im-
proved business conditions, others—especially those 
with ties to small businesses and the hospitality, aviation, 
and nonresidential construction industries—were still 
seeing very difficult circumstances.  Contacts reported 
improved conditions in the agricultural sector, boosted 
by strong demand from China as well as domestic etha-
nol production, higher crop prices, and federal aid pay-
ments.  Looking ahead, some business contacts ex-
pressed concerns that many households and businesses 
were currently in a weaker position to weather additional 
economic shocks than they had been at the beginning of 
the pandemic.   
Participants observed that labor market conditions had 
continued to improve in recent months, with roughly 
half of the 22 million jobs lost over March and April 
having been regained.  The unemployment rate had de-
clined further, and the employment gains since the 
spring were generally seen as larger than anticipated.  
Business contacts in a couple of Districts—particularly 
those in the manufacturing, health-care, and technology 
sectors—reported having trouble hiring workers for rea-
sons likely related to virus cases or workers’ need to pro-
vide childcare.  Several participants noted that the de-
cline in the unemployment rate in recent months had 
been accompanied by a fall in the labor force participa-
tion rate, particularly among those with a high school 
education or lower and among women.  Although the 
number of workers on temporary layoff had fallen 

_____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of November 4–5, 2020Page 9sharply, the number of permanent job losers had contin-
ued to rise.  Most participants commented that the pace 
of labor market improvement was likely to moderate go-
ing forward.  A couple of them noted that many busi-
nesses in industries severely affected by the pandemic 
were downsizing or that some businesses were focused 
on cutting costs or increasing productivity, including 
through automation.  Many participants observed that 
high rates of job losses had been especially prevalent 
among lower-wage workers, particularly in the services 
sector, and among women, African Americans, and His-
panics. A few participants noted that these trends, if 
slow to reverse, could exacerbate racial, gender, and 
other social-economic disparities.  In addition, a slow job 
market recovery would cause particular hardship for 
those with less educational attainment, less access to 
childcare or broadband, or greater need for retraining.   
In their comments about inflation, participants noted 
that some consumer prices had increased more quickly 
than expected in recent months but that broader price 
trends were still quite soft.  The upturn in consumer 
price inflation was primarily attributed to price increases 
in sectors where the pandemic had induced stronger de-
mand, such as consumer durables.  In contrast, services 
price inflation remained softer than pre-pandemic rates, 
as prices for the categories most affected by social dis-
tancing, such as accommodations and airfares, contin-
ued to be very depressed and housing services inflation 
moderated.  Several participants commented on the un-
usually large relative price movements caused by the 
pandemic and the considerable uncertainty as to how 
long these price changes would persist.    
Participants noted that financial conditions were gener-
ally accommodative and that actions by the Federal Re-
serve, including the establishment of emergency lending 
facilities with the approval of and, in some cases, provi-
sion of equity investments by the Treasury, were sup-
porting the flow of credit to households, businesses, and 
communities.  While these actions were viewed as con-
tributing to accommodative financial conditions, partic-
ipants noted important differences in credit availability 
across borrowers.  In particular, financing conditions 
eased further for residential mortgage borrowers and for 
large corporations that were able to access capital mar-
kets, but surveys of credit availability indicated that bank 
lending conditions tightened further.  A few participants 
noted that the financing conditions for small businesses 
were especially worrisome, as the PPP had ended and 
the prospect for additional fiscal support remained un-
certain.  They pointed to the most recent Census Bureau 
Small Business Pulse Survey, in which more than half of 

the respondents reported having no more than two 
months of cash on hand.   
Participants continued to see the uncertainty surround-
ing the economic outlook as quite elevated, with the path 
of the economy highly dependent on the course of the 
virus; on how individuals, businesses, and public officials 
responded to it; and on the effectiveness of public health 
measures to address it.  Participants cited several down-
side risks that could threaten the recovery.  While an-
other broad economic shutdown was seen as unlikely, 
participants remained concerned about the possibility of 
a further resurgence of the virus that could undermine 
the recovery.  The majority of participants also saw the 
risk that current and expected fiscal support for house-
holds, businesses, and state and local governments might 
not be sufficient to sustain activity levels in those sectors, 
while a few participants noted that additional fiscal stim-
ulus that was larger than anticipated could be an upside 
risk.  Some participants commented that the recent surge 
in virus cases in Europe and the reimposition of re-
strictions there could lead to a slowdown in economic 
activity in the euro area and have negative spillover ef-
fects on the U.S. recovery.  Some participants raised con-
cerns regarding the longer-run effects of the pandemic, 
including sectoral restructurings that could slow employ-
ment growth or an acceleration of technological disrup-
tions that could be limiting the pricing power of some 
firms. 
A number of participants commented on various poten-
tial risks to financial stability.  A few participants noted 
that the banking system showed considerable resilience 
through the end of the third quarter, and a few observed 
that this resilience partly reflected stronger-than-ex-
pected balance sheets of their customers, with delin-
quency rates declining or showing only moderate in-
creases.  Moreover, capital positions and loan loss re-
serves for large banks were higher than before the pan-
demic.  Several participants emphasized the need to en-
sure that banks continue to maintain strong capital lev-
els, as lower levels of capital are typically associated with 
tighter credit availability from banks.  Several partici-
pants commented on the vulnerabilities witnessed dur-
ing the March selloff in the Treasury market.  The sub-
stantial maturity and liquidity transformations under-
taken by some nonbank financial institutions—such as 
prime MMFs and corporate bond and bank loan mutual 
funds—were also discussed.  A couple of participants 
expressed concerns that a prolonged period of low in-
terest rates and highly accommodative financial market 
conditions could lead to excessive risk-taking, which in 

Page 10Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________turn could result in elevated firm bankruptcies and sig-
nificant employment losses in the next economic down-
turn.  A few participants noted that climate change poses 
important challenges to financial stability and welcomed 
analysis of climate change as both a source of shocks and 
an underlying vulnerability.  A couple of participants 
commented that the actions taken by the Federal Re-
serve to support the economy and achieve its mandated 
goals also supported financial stability.  Relatedly, several 
participants emphasized the important roles various sec-
tion 13(3) facilities played in restoring financial market 
confidence and supporting financial stability; they noted 
that these facilities were still serving as an important 
backstop in financial markets.  A few participants noted 
that it was important to extend them beyond year-end.  
In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, 
participants reaffirmed the Federal Reserve’s commit-
ment to using its full range of tools in order to support 
the U.S. economy during this challenging time, thereby 
promoting the Committee’s statutory goals of maximum 
employment and price stability.  Participants agreed that 
the path of the economy would depend significantly on 
the course of the virus and that the ongoing public 
health crisis would continue to weigh on economic ac-
tivity, employment, and inflation in the near term and 
posed considerable risks to the economic outlook over 
the medium term.  In light of this assessment, all partic-
ipants judged that maintaining an accommodative stance 
of monetary policy was essential to foster economic re-
covery and to achieve the Committee’s long-run 2 per-
cent inflation objective.   
Participants remarked that the Committee’s action in 
September to provide more explicit outcome-based for-
ward guidance for the federal funds rate had been an im-
portant step to affirm the Committee’s strong commit-
ment to the goals and strategy articulated in its revised 
Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy 
Strategy.  Several participants noted that they were en-
couraged by evidence that suggested that market partic-
ipants’ expectations of the economic conditions that 
would likely prevail at the time of liftoff seemed broadly 
consistent with the Committee’s forward guidance and 
revised consensus statement.   
Participants agreed that monetary policy was providing 
substantial accommodation, and most concurred that, 
with the federal funds rate at the ELB, much of that ac-
commodation was due to the Committee’s forward guid-
ance and increases in securities holdings.  They judged 
that the current stance of monetary policy remained ap-
propriate, as both employment and inflation remained 

well short of the Committee’s goals and the uncertainty 
about the course of the virus and the outlook for the 
economy continued to be very elevated.  Participants 
viewed the resurgence of COVID-19 cases in the United 
States and abroad as a downside risk to the recovery; a 
few participants noted that diminished odds for further 
significant fiscal support also increased downside risks 
and added to uncertainty about the economic outlook.   
Regarding asset purchases, participants judged that it 
would be appropriate over coming months for the Fed-
eral Reserve to increase its holdings of Treasury securi-
ties and agency MBS at least at the current pace.  These 
actions would continue to help sustain smooth market 
functioning and help foster accommodative financial 
conditions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to 
households and businesses.  Many participants judged 
that the Committee might want to enhance its guidance 
for asset purchases fairly soon.  Most participants fa-
vored moving to qualitative outcome-based guidance for 
asset purchases that links the horizon over which the 
Committee anticipates it would be conducting asset pur-
chases to economic conditions.  A few participants were 
hesitant to make changes in the near term to the guid-
ance for asset purchases and pointed to considerable un-
certainty about the economic outlook and the appropri-
ate use of balance sheet policies given that uncertainty. 

Discussion on Recommended Changes to the Sum-
mary of Economic Projections 

Participants considered two recommendations from the 
subcommittee on communications for changes to the 
Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) that would 
enhance the information provided to the public.  These 
recommendations included accelerating the release of 
the full set of SEP exhibits from three weeks after the 
corresponding FOMC meeting, when the minutes of 
that meeting are released, to the day of the policy deci-
sion and adding new charts that display a time series of 
diffusion indexes for participants’ judgments of uncer-
tainty and risks.  With these recommendations, the writ-
ten summary of the projections that has been included 
as an addendum to the minutes of the corresponding 
FOMC meeting would be discontinued. 
Most of the participants who commented noted that re-
leasing all SEP materials at the time of the postmeeting 
statement would provide greater context for the policy 
decision, highlight the risk-management factors relevant 
for the decision, or further emphasize the degree of un-
certainty around participants’ modal projections.  Some 
who commented noted that the SEP serves a valuable 
role in illustrating how participants’ policy assessments 

_____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of November 4–5, 2020Page 11respond to changes in the economic outlook.  Most par-
ticipants who commented suggested that it would be 
useful to continue thinking about options for refining 
the SEP.  Participants unanimously supported the rec-
ommended changes and agreed that they should be im-
plemented beginning in December. 

Committee Policy Action 

In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, 
members agreed that the COVID-19 pandemic was 
causing tremendous human and economic hardship 
across the United States and around the world.  They 
noted that economic activity and employment had con-
tinued to recover but remained well below their levels at 
the beginning of the year, and that weaker demand and 
earlier declines in oil prices had been holding down con-
sumer price inflation.  Overall financial conditions re-
mained accommodative, 
in part reflecting policy 
measures to support the economy and the flow of credit 
to U.S. households and businesses.  Members agreed 
that the Federal Reserve was committed to using its full 
range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this chal-
lenging time, thereby promoting its maximum-employ-
ment and price-stability goals.  Members also stated that 
the path of the economy would depend significantly on 
the course of the virus.  In addition, members agreed 
that the ongoing public health crisis would continue to 
weigh on economic activity, employment, and inflation 
in the near term and was posing considerable risks to the 
economic outlook over the medium term.   
All members reaffirmed that, in accordance with the 
Committee’s goals to achieve maximum employment 
and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run 
and with inflation running persistently below this longer-
run goal, they would aim to achieve inflation moderately 
above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 
2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expecta-
tions remain well anchored at 2 percent.  Members ex-
pected to maintain an accommodative stance of mone-
tary policy until those outcomes were achieved.  All 
members agreed to maintain the target range for the fed-
eral funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent, and they expected that 
it would be appropriate to maintain this target range un-
til labor market conditions had reached levels consistent 
with the Committee’s assessments of maximum employ-
ment and inflation had risen to 2 percent and was on 
track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.  In 
addition, members agreed that over coming months it 
would be appropriate for the Federal Reserve to increase 
its holdings of Treasury securities and agency MBS at 
least at the current pace to sustain smooth market func-

tioning and help foster accommodative financial condi-
tions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to house-
holds and businesses. 
Members agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance 
of monetary policy, they would continue to monitor the 
implications of incoming information for the economic 
outlook and that they would be prepared to adjust the 
stance of monetary policy as appropriate in the event 
that risks emerged that could impede the attainment of 
the Committee’s goals.  Members also agreed that, in as-
sessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they 
would take into account a wide range of information, in-
cluding readings on public health, labor market condi-
tions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and 
financial and international developments. 
At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee 
voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank 
of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute 
transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the fol-
lowing domestic policy directive, for release at 2:00 p.m.: 
“Effective November 6, 2020, the Federal 
Open Market Committee directs the Desk to:  
 Undertake open market operations as nec-
essary to maintain the federal funds rate in 
a target range of 0 to ¼ percent. 
Increase the System Open Market Ac-
count holdings of Treasury securities and 
agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) 
at the current pace.  Increase holdings of 
Treasury securities and agency MBS by ad-
ditional amounts and purchase agency 
commercial mortgage-backed securities 
(CMBS) as needed to sustain smooth func-
tioning of markets for these securities. 
 Conduct term and overnight repurchase 
agreement operations to support effective 
policy implementation and the smooth 
functioning of short-term U.S. dollar 
funding markets. 
 Conduct overnight reverse repurchase 
agreement operations at an offering rate of 
0.00 percent and with a per-counterparty 
limit of $30 billion per day; the per-coun-
terparty limit can be temporarily increased 
at the discretion of the Chair. 
 Roll over at auction all principal payments 
from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of 
Treasury securities and reinvest all princi-
pal payments from the Federal Reserve’s 

 

Page 12Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________holdings of agency debt and agency MBS 
in agency MBS. 
 Allow modest deviations from stated 
amounts for purchases and reinvestments, 
if needed for operational reasons. 
 Engage in dollar roll and coupon swap 
transactions as necessary to facilitate set-
tlement of the Federal Reserve’s agency 
MBS transactions.” 
The vote also encompassed approval of the statement 
below for release at 2:00 p.m.: 
“The Federal Reserve is committed to using its 
full range of tools to support the U.S. economy 
in this challenging time, thereby promoting its 
maximum employment and price stability goals. 
The COVID-19 pandemic is causing tremen-
dous human and economic hardship across the 
United States and around the world.  Economic 
activity and employment have continued to re-
cover but remain well below their levels at the 
beginning of the year.  Weaker demand and ear-
lier declines in oil prices have been holding 
down consumer price inflation.  Overall finan-
cial conditions remain accommodative, in part 
reflecting policy measures to support the econ-
omy and the flow of credit to U.S. households 
and businesses. 
The path of the economy will depend signifi-
cantly on the course of the virus.  The ongoing 
public health crisis will continue to weigh on 
economic activity, employment, and inflation in 
the near term, and poses considerable risks to 
the economic outlook over the medium term. 
The Committee seeks to achieve maximum em-
ployment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent 
over the longer run.  With inflation running per-
sistently below this longer-run goal, the Com-
mittee will aim to achieve inflation moderately 
above 2 percent for some time so that inflation 
averages 2 percent over time and longer-term 
inflation expectations remain well anchored at 
2 percent.  The Committee expects to maintain 
an accommodative stance of monetary policy 
until these outcomes are achieved.  The Com-
mittee decided to keep the target range for the 
federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and expects 
it will be appropriate to maintain this target 
range until 
labor market conditions have 
reached levels consistent with the Committee’s 

assessments of maximum employment and in-
flation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to 
moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.  In 
addition, over coming months the Federal Re-
serve will increase its holdings of Treasury secu-
rities and agency mortgage-backed securities at 
least at the current pace to sustain smooth mar-
ket functioning and help foster accommodative 
financial conditions, thereby supporting the 
flow of credit to households and businesses. 
In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary 
policy, the Committee will continue to monitor 
the implications of incoming information for 
the economic outlook.  The Committee would 
be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary 
policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could 
impede the attainment of the Committee’s 
goals.  The Committee’s assessments will take 
into account a wide range of information, in-
cluding readings on public health, labor market 
conditions, inflation pressures and inflation ex-
pectations, and financial and international de-
velopments.” 
Voting for this action:  Jerome H. Powell, John C. 
Williams, Michelle W. Bowman, Lael Brainard, Richard 
H. Clarida, Mary C. Daly, Patrick Harker, Robert S. 
Kaplan, Loretta J. Mester, and Randal K. Quarles. 

Voting against this action:  None. 

Ms. Daly voted as alternate member at this meeting. 
Consistent with the Committee’s decision to leave the 
target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the 
Board of Governors voted unanimously to leave the in-
terest rates on required and excess reserve balances at 
0.10 percent.  The Board of Governors also voted unan-
imously to approve establishment of the primary credit 
rate at the existing level of 0.25 percent, effective No-
vember 6, 2020. 
It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee 
would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, December 15–
16, 2020.  The meeting adjourned at 10:05 a.m. on No-
vember 5, 2020. 

Notation Votes
