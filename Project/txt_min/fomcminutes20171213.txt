Developments in Financial Markets and Open Mar-
ket Operations 

The manager of the System Open Market Account 
(SOMA) reported on developments in domestic and in-
ternational financial markets over the intermeeting pe-
riod.  Equity prices moved higher over the period, with 
market participants pointing to the likely passage of tax 
reform legislation as an important factor contributing to 
the rise.  The narrowing of the spread between long- and 
short-term Treasury yields over recent months had been 
a focus of market attention.  Market participants cited a 
range of factors as contributing to this narrowing, in-
cluding the gradual firming in the stance of monetary 
policy as well as an increasing expectation among inves-

tors that the Treasury Department would issue substan-
tial volumes of shorter-term securities in meeting its fi-
nancing needs over coming years. 
The deputy manager discussed open market operations 
over the period.  Take-up at the System’s overnight re-
verse repurchase (ON RRP) agreement facility dropped 
to relatively low levels over the period.  In part, the de-
cline appeared to reflect an increase in yields on alterna-
tive investments; Treasury bill yields, for example, had 
moved higher over recent weeks as the Treasury boosted 
net issuance of Treasury bills.  The Open Market Desk 
continued to execute reinvestment operations for Treas-
ury and agency securities in the SOMA in accordance 
with the procedure specified in the Committee’s di-
rective to the Desk.  The deputy manager also provided 
an update on plans for the Federal Reserve Bank of New 
York, in conjunction with the Treasury’s Office of Fi-
nancial Research, to begin publishing reference interest 
rates for repurchase agreements involving Treasury se-
curities by the middle of next year. 
By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s 
domestic transactions over the intermeeting period.  
There were no intervention operations in foreign curren-
cies for the System’s account during the intermeeting pe-
riod. 

Staff Review of the Economic Situation 

The information reviewed for the December 12–13 
meeting indicated that labor market conditions contin-
ued to strengthen through November and suggested that 
real gross domestic product (GDP) was rising at a solid 
pace in the second half of 2017.  Total consumer price 
inflation, as measured by the 12-month percentage 
change in the price index for personal consumption ex-
penditures (PCE), remained below 2 percent in October 
and was lower than early in the year.  Survey-based 
measures of longer-run inflation expectations were little 
changed on balance. 
Total nonfarm payroll employment increased strongly in 
October and November, likely reflecting in part a re-
bound from the negative effects of the hurricanes in 
September.  The national unemployment rate declined 
to 4.1 percent in October and remained at that level in 
November.  The unemployment rates for Hispanics, for 
Asians, and for whites were lower in November than 
two months earlier, while the rate for African Americans 
was a little higher; the unemployment rates for each of 
these groups were close to the levels seen just before the 
most recent recession.  The national labor force partici-
pation rate was lower in November than it had been in 

Page 2Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                 
September but remained in the range seen over the past 
several years.  The share of workers employed part time 
for economic reasons declined in October and was 
about unchanged in November.  The rates of private-
sector job openings and quits were little changed at rela-
tively high levels in September and October, and the 
four-week moving average of initial claims for unem-
ployment insurance benefits continued to be at a low 
level in early December.  Recent readings showed that 
wage gains remained modest.  Compensation per hour 
in the nonfarm business sector increased 1 percent over 
the four quarters ending in the third quarter, and average 
hourly earnings for all employees rose 2½ percent over 
the 12 months ending in November. 
Total industrial production increased briskly in October, 
boosted in part by a continued return to more-normal 
operations that reflected the waning of the negative ef-
fects of recent hurricanes in the previous two months.  
Automakers’ schedules indicated that light motor vehicle 
assemblies would likely move up in the coming months.  
Broader indicators of manufacturing production, such as 
the new orders indexes from national and regional man-
ufacturing surveys, pointed to further increases in fac-
tory output in the near term. 
Real PCE increased modestly in October after expand-
ing strongly in September.  The pace of light motor ve-
hicle sales slowed in November from the elevated rate in 
the preceding two months but continued to be above 
levels seen earlier in the year.  Recent readings on key 
factors that influence consumer spending—including 
gains in employment, real disposable personal income, 
and households’ net worth—continued to be supportive 
of moderate real PCE growth in the fourth quarter.  
Consumer sentiment in early December, as measured by 
the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers, re-
mained at a high level. 
Recent information on housing activity suggested that 
real residential investment spending was edging up in the 
fourth quarter after declining in the previous two quar-
ters.  Both starts and building permit issuance for new 
single-family homes increased somewhat in October, 
and starts for multifamily units moved up considerably.  
Sales of both new and existing homes rose moderately 
in October. 
Real private expenditures for business equipment and in-
tellectual property appeared to be rising further in the 
fourth quarter.  Nominal shipments of nondefense cap-
ital goods excluding aircraft increased in October, and 
new orders of these goods continued to exceed ship-
ments, which pointed to further gains in shipments in 

the near term.  In addition, readings on business senti-
ment remained upbeat.  Firms’ nominal spending for 
nonresidential structures excluding drilling and mining 
rose in October, and the number of oil and gas rigs in 
operation—an indicator of spending for structures in 
the drilling and mining sector—started to edge up in late 
November after declining earlier in the fourth quarter. 
Total real government purchases looked to be rising in 
the fourth quarter.  Nominal defense expenditures in 
October and November pointed to a flattening in real 
federal government purchases.  However, real purchases 
by state and local governments appeared to be moving 
up, as these governments expanded their payrolls mod-
estly over the two months ending in November and their 
nominal construction spending increased in October. 
The nominal U.S. international trade deficit widened 
slightly in September and sharply in October.  Exports 
picked up in September, led by exports of industrial sup-
plies, but were flat in October.  Imports grew signifi-
cantly in both months, reflecting strength in most cate-
gories, although imports of automobiles declined.  The 
available trade data suggested that the change in real net 
exports would make a neutral contribution to real U.S. 
GDP growth in the fourth quarter. 
Total U.S. consumer prices, as measured by the PCE 
price index, increased slightly more than 1½ percent 
over the 12 months ending in October.  Core PCE price 
inflation, which excludes changes in consumer food and 
energy prices, was nearly 1½ percent over that same pe-
riod.  The consumer price index (CPI) rose 2¼ percent 
over the 12 months ending in November, while core CPI 
inflation was 1¾ percent.  Recent readings on survey-
based measures of longer-run inflation expectations—
including those from the Michigan survey, the Survey of 
Professional Forecasters, and the Desk’s Survey of Pri-
mary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants—were 
little changed on balance. 
Economic activity expanded at a solid pace in most for-
eign economies in the third quarter.  In several advanced 
foreign economies (AFEs), economic growth slowed 
but remained firm.  Economic activity in the emerging 
market economies (EMEs) continued to grow briskly for 
the most part, especially in Asia.  However, the Mexican 
economy contracted in the third quarter, as hurricanes 
and earthquakes disrupted economic activity.  Despite a 
boost from recent increases in oil prices, inflation re-
mained relatively subdued in most AFEs and moderate 
in EMEs. 

Minutes of the Meeting of December 12–13, 2017Page 3_____________________________________________________________________________________________ 
 
 
 
Staff Review of the Financial Situation 

Movements in domestic financial asset prices over the 
intermeeting period reflected slightly stronger-than- 
expected economic data releases, announcements re-
lated to Treasury debt issuance, and an increase in the 
perceived probability that the Congress would enact tax 
legislation.  On net, the Treasury yield curve flattened, 
U.S. equity prices moved up, and the foreign exchange 
value of the dollar was little changed.  Financing condi-
tions for businesses and households remained broadly 
supportive of continued growth in household spending 
and business investment. 
Federal Reserve communications and economic data re-
leases over the intermeeting period were characterized 
by market participants as reinforcing perceptions of a 
likely increase in the target range for the federal funds 
rate at the December meeting.  The probability of an in-
crease as implied by quotes on federal funds futures con-
tracts edged up to around 95 percent, roughly consistent 
with the average probability indicated by responses to 
the Desk’s surveys of primary dealers and market partic-
ipants in December. 
The nominal Treasury yield curve flattened over the in-
termeeting period, as short-dated Treasury yields rose 
and the 10-year Treasury yield moved up only slightly.  
Market participants pointed to the November 1 release 
of the Treasury’s quarterly financing statement and ac-
companying analysis by the Treasury Borrowing Advi-
sory Committee that highlighted some advantages of in-
creasing issuance of relatively short-dated Treasury se-
curities as factors contributing to the flattening of the 
yield curve over the period.  Measures of inflation com-
pensation based on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securi-
ties were little changed, on net, over the intermeeting pe-
riod.  Option-adjusted spreads of yields on current- 
coupon mortgage-backed securities (MBS) over Treas-
ury yields also were little changed.  Overall, market par-
ticipants did not attribute any price changes in Treasury 
and agency MBS markets to the implementation of re-
ductions in reinvestments of the SOMA portfolio. 
Broad equity price indexes rose over the intermeeting 
period, likely reflecting in part investors’ perceptions of 
increased odds for the passage of federal tax legislation 
and an associated potential boost to corporate earnings.  
One-month-ahead option-implied volatility on the 
S&P 500 index—the VIX—was little changed, on net, at 
levels close to historical lows.  Spreads on both invest-
ment- and speculative-grade corporate bond yields over 
comparable-maturity Treasury yields were about flat on 
net. 

Conditions in short-term funding markets remained sta-
ble over the intermeeting period.  The effective federal 
funds rate held steady, and rates and volumes in other 
overnight markets were little changed.  Take-up of ON 
RRPs declined notably as Treasury bill supply continued 
to increase, and short-dated bill yields rose to levels sig-
nificantly above the ON RRP offering rate.  On Decem-
ber 11, the Treasury declared a debt issuance suspension 
period to keep outstanding federal debt below the debt 
ceiling and began to use extraordinary measures to allow 
continued financing of government operations. 
Financing conditions for large nonfinancial corporations 
continued to be accommodative on balance.  Gross is-
suance of corporate bonds and gross equity issuance re-
mained robust.  Institutional leveraged loan issuance in 
November was brisk.  Growth of bank-intermediated 
credit to nonfinancial firms, however, was tepid.  On 
balance, the credit quality of nonfinancial corporations 
was little changed over the intermeeting period and ap-
peared to remain solid.  Financing conditions for small 
businesses also appeared to have remained favorable.  In 
municipal bond markets, gross issuance was strong and 
credit quality remained stable. 
In commercial real estate (CRE) markets, spreads of 
commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) yields 
over comparable-maturity Treasury yields remained near 
the lower end of the range seen since the financial crisis, 
and delinquency rates on loans in CMBS pools contin-
ued to decrease.  The growth of CRE loans held by the 
largest banks continued to slow, while CRE loan growth 
at smaller banks remained strong overall and even 
picked up a bit in October. 
In the residential mortgage market, although credit 
standards had loosened gradually for borrowers with low 
credit scores, they continued to be tight for borrowers 
with low credit scores and hard-to-document incomes.  
Mortgage credit remained readily available for borrowers 
with strong credit scores.  Similarly, consumer credit re-
mained readily available to borrowers with strong credit 
histories, but conditions for subprime borrowers stayed 
tight in credit card markets and continued to tighten for 
auto loans.  Issuance of asset-backed securities (ABS) 
funding consumer loans was robust in recent months, 
and ABS spreads were about unchanged over the inter-
meeting period. 
On balance, the broad index of the foreign exchange 
value of the dollar was little changed, longer-term sover-
eign bond yields in AFEs declined modestly, and most 
foreign equity indexes moved lower over the intermeet-
ing period.  The euro appreciated modestly against the 
U.S. dollar, in part because of strong economic data for 

Page 4Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ 
 
 
 
the euro area early in the intermeeting period.  The Brit-
ish pound was somewhat volatile amid Brexit-related de-
velopments, and the Mexican peso fluctuated on news 
about negotiations associated with the North American 
Free Trade Agreement, but both currencies ended the 
period little changed.  Following missed interest pay-
ments on its sovereign bonds, Venezuela was assigned 
selective default status by two credit rating agencies in 
early November, which precipitated a “credit event” rul-
ing by the International Swaps and Derivatives Associa-
tion.  However, developments related to Venezuela gen-
erated little spillover to global financial markets. 

Staff Economic Outlook 

The U.S. economic projection prepared by the staff for 
the December FOMC meeting was generally compara-
ble with the staff’s previous forecast.  Real GDP was 
forecast to have increased at a solid pace in the second 
half of 2017.  Beyond 2017, the forecast for real GDP 
growth was revised up modestly, reflecting the staff’s up-
dated assumption that the reduction in federal income 
taxes expected to begin next year would be larger than 
assumed in the previous projection.  The staff projected 
that real GDP would increase at a modestly faster pace 
than potential output through 2019.  The unemployment 
rate was projected to decline further over the next few 
years and to continue running below the staff’s slightly 
downward-revised estimate of the longer-run natural 
rate over this period. 
The staff’s forecast for total PCE price inflation was re-
vised up a little for 2017, as somewhat higher forecasts 
for core PCE prices and for consumer energy prices 
were offset only partially by a lower forecast for con-
sumer food prices.  Total PCE price inflation in 2018 
was projected to be about the same as in 2017, despite 
projected declines in consumer energy prices; core PCE 
prices were forecast to rise faster in 2018, reflecting the 
expected waning of transitory factors that held down 
those prices in 2017.  Beyond 2018, the inflation forecast 
was little changed from the previous projection.  The 
staff projected that inflation would be very close to the 
Committee’s 2 percent objective in 2019 and at that ob-
jective in 2020. 
The staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections 
for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and infla-
tion as similar to the average of the past 20 years.  On 
the one hand, many indicators of uncertainty about the 
macroeconomic outlook continued to be subdued; on 

the other hand, considerable uncertainty remained about 
a number of federal government policies relevant for the 
economic outlook.  The staff saw the risks to the fore-
casts for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate 
as balanced.  The risks to the projection for inflation also 
were seen as balanced.  Downside risks to inflation in-
cluded the possibility that longer-term inflation expecta-
tions may move lower or that the run of soft core infla-
tion readings this year could prove to be more persistent 
than the staff expected.  These downside risks were seen 
as essentially counterbalanced by the upside risk that in-
flation could increase more than expected in an econ-
omy that was projected to move further above its poten-
tial. 

Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the 
Economic Outlook 

In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, members of 
the Board of Governors and Federal Reserve Bank pres-
idents submitted their projections of the most likely out-
comes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, 
and inflation for each year from 2017 through 2020 and 
over the longer run, based on their individual assess-
ments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate.4  
The longer-run projections represented each partici-
pant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable 
would be expected to converge, over time, under appro-
priate monetary policy and in the absence of further 
shocks to the economy.  These projections and policy 
assessments are described in the Summary of Economic 
Projections (SEP), which is an addendum to these 
minutes. 
In their discussion of economic conditions and the out-
look, meeting participants agreed that information re-
ceived since the FOMC met in November indicated that 
economic activity had been rising at a solid rate and that 
the labor market had continued to strengthen.  Averag-
ing through fluctuations associated with the recent hur-
ricanes, job gains had been solid and the unemployment 
rate had declined further.  Household spending had been 
expanding at a moderate rate, and growth in business 
fixed investment had picked up in recent quarters.  On a 
12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for 
items other than food and energy had declined this year 
and were running below 2 percent.  Market-based 
measures of inflation compensation remained low;  
survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expecta-
tions were little changed, on balance. 

4 The incoming president of the Federal Reserve Bank of 
Richmond is scheduled to assume office on January 1, 2018; 
First Vice President Mark L. Mullinix submitted economic 

projections for this meeting.  One participant did not submit 
longer-run projections for real output growth, the unemploy-
ment rate, or the federal funds rate.

Real economic activity appeared to be growing at a solid 
pace, buttressed by gains in consumer and business 
spending, supportive financial conditions, and an im-
proving global economy.  Participants judged that  
hurricane-related disruptions and rebuilding had af-
fected economic activity, employment, and inflation in 
recent months but had not materially altered the outlook 
for the national economy.  They saw the incoming infor-
mation on spending and the labor market as consistent 
with continued above-trend growth and a further 
strengthening in labor market conditions.  Conse-
quently, participants continued to expect that, with grad-
ual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, eco-
nomic activity would expand at a moderate pace and la-
bor market conditions would remain strong.  Inflation 
on a 12-month basis was expected to remain somewhat 
below 2 percent in the near term but to stabilize around 
the Committee’s 2 percent objective over the medium 
term.  Near-term risks to the economic outlook ap-
peared to be roughly balanced, but participants agreed 
that it would be important to continue to monitor infla-
tion developments closely. 
Participants expected moderate growth in consumer 
spending in the near term, underpinned by ongoing 
strength in the labor market, further improvements in 
households’ net worth, and buoyant consumer senti-
ment.  Business contacts in a few Districts reported 
strong pre-holiday sales.  Many participants expected the 
proposed cuts in personal taxes to provide some boost 
to consumer spending.  A few participants noted that 
expectations of tax reform may have already raised con-
sumer spending somewhat to the extent that those ex-
pectations had spurred increases in asset valuations and 
household net worth.  A number of participants ex-
pressed uncertainty about the magnitude of the effects 
of tax reform on consumer spending. 
District contacts were optimistic, and their reports were 
generally consistent with continued steady growth in 
business spending.  Reports from District contacts 
about both the manufacturing and service sectors were 
generally positive.  In contrast, reports on housing and 
nonresidential construction were mixed.  Activity in the 
energy sector continued to firm, with transportation bot-
tlenecks and residual effects of the hurricanes putting 
some upward pressure on gasoline prices.  In the agri-
cultural sector, farm income was under downward pres-
sure due to low crop prices, and contacts expressed con-
cern about the effects of the possible renegotiation of 
trade agreements on exports. 
Many participants judged that the proposed changes in 
business taxes, if enacted, would likely provide a modest 

boost to capital spending, although the magnitude of the 
effects was uncertain.  The resulting increase in the cap-
ital stock could contribute to positive supply-side effects, 
including an expansion of potential output over the next 
few years.  However, some business contacts and re-
spondents to business surveys suggested that firms were 
cautious about expanding capital spending in response 
to the proposed tax changes or noted that the increase 
in cash flow that would result from corporate tax cuts 
was more likely to be used for mergers and acquisitions 
or for debt reduction and stock buybacks. 
Labor market conditions continued to strengthen in re-
cent months, with the unemployment rate declining fur-
ther and payroll gains well above a pace consistent with 
maintaining a stable unemployment rate over time.  
Other indicators, such as consumer and business surveys 
of job availability and job openings, also pointed to a 
further tightening in labor market conditions.  A couple 
of participants noted that broad improvements in labor 
market conditions over the past several years were evi-
dent across demographic groups.  In several Districts, 
reports from business contacts or evidence from surveys 
pointed to some difficulty in finding qualified workers; 
in some cases, labor shortages were making it hard to fill 
customer demand or expand business.  A few partici-
pants noted that a reduction in personal tax rates could 
potentially increase labor supply, but the magnitude of 
such effects was quite uncertain. 
Against the backdrop of the continued strengthening in 
labor market conditions, participants discussed recent 
wage developments.  Overall, the pace of wage increases 
had generally been modest and in line with inflation and 
productivity growth.  In some Districts, reports from 
business contacts or evidence from surveys pointed to a 
pickup in wage gains, particularly for unskilled or entry-
level workers.  In a couple of regions, businesses facing 
tight labor market conditions were said to be offering 
more flexible work arrangements or taking advantage of 
technology to use employees more efficiently, rather 
than raising wages.  A few participants judged that the 
tightness in labor markets was likely to translate into an 
acceleration in wages; however, another observed that 
the absence of broad-based upward wage pressures sug-
gested that there might be scope for further improve-
ment in labor market conditions. 
PCE price inflation over the 12 months ending in Octo-
ber, at 1.6 percent, continued to run below the Commit-
tee’s longer-run objective of 2 percent; core PCE price 
inflation for items other than consumer food and energy 
prices was only 1.4 percent over the same period.  It was 
noted that recent readings on monthly inflation had 

Page 6Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ 
 
 
 
edged up, and a couple of participants observed that 
core inflation on a year-over-year basis appeared to be 
stabilizing.  Many indicated that they expected cyclical 
pressures associated with a tightening labor market to 
show through to higher inflation over the medium term.  
These participants generally judged that much of the 
softness in core inflation this year reflected transitory 
factors and that inflation would begin to rise as the in-
fluence of these factors waned.  However, one of them 
noted that secular trends, such as technological innova-
tion or globalization, could be affecting competition and 
business pricing, and muting inflationary pressures.  
With core inflation readings having moved down this 
year and remaining well below 2 percent, some partici-
pants observed that there was a possibility that inflation 
might stay below the objective for longer than they cur-
rently expected.  Several of them expressed concern that 
persistently weak inflation may have led to a decline in 
longer-term inflation expectations; they pointed to low 
market-based measures of inflation compensation, de-
clines in some survey measures of inflation expectations, 
or evidence from statistical models suggesting that the 
underlying trend in inflation had fallen in recent years.  
A few participants, however, noted that measures of in-
flation expectations had remained broadly stable this 
year despite the low readings on inflation and judged that 
this stability should support the return of inflation to the 
Committee’s 2 percent objective. 
With regard to financial markets, some participants ob-
served that financial conditions remained accommoda-
tive, citing a range of indicators including low interest 
rates, narrow credit spreads, high equity values, a lower 
dollar, and some evidence of easier terms for lending to 
risky borrowers.  In light of elevated asset valuations and 
low financial market volatility, a couple of participants 
expressed concern that the persistence of highly accom-
modative financial conditions could, over time, pose 
risks to financial stability.  Participants also noted that 
term premiums on longer-term nominal Treasury secu-
rities remained low.  A number of factors were seen as 
possibly contributing to the low levels of term premi-
ums, including large holdings of longer-term assets by 
major central banks, persistently low global inflation, 
and substantial global demand for assets with long dura-
tions. 
Meeting participants also discussed the recent narrowing 
of the gap between the yields on long- and short- 
maturity nominal Treasury securities, which had resulted 
in a flatter profile of the term structure of interest rates.  
Among the factors contributing to the flattening, partic-
ipants pointed to recent increases in the target range for 
the federal funds rate, reductions in investors’ estimates 

of the longer-run neutral real interest rate, lower longer-
term inflation expectations, and lower term premiums.  
They generally agreed that the current degree of flatness 
of the yield curve was not unusual by historical stand-
ards.  However, several participants thought that it 
would be important to continue to monitor the slope of 
the yield curve.  Some expressed concern that a possible 
future inversion of the yield curve, with short-term yields 
rising above those on longer-term Treasury securities, 
could portend an economic slowdown, noting that in-
versions have preceded recessions over the past several 
decades, or that a protracted yield curve inversion could 
adversely affect the financial condition of banks and 
other financial institutions and pose risks to financial sta-
bility.  A couple of other participants viewed the flatten-
ing of the yield curve as an expected consequence of in-
creases in the Committee’s target range for the federal 
funds rate, and judged that a yield curve inversion under 
such circumstances would not necessarily foreshadow or 
cause an economic downturn.  It was also noted that 
contacts in the financial sector generally did not express 
concern about the recent flattening of the term structure. 
In their discussion of monetary policy, participants saw 
the outlook for economic activity and the labor market 
as having remained strong or having strengthened since 
their previous meeting, in part reflecting a modest boost 
from the expected passage of the tax legislation under 
consideration.  Regarding inflation, participants gener-
ally viewed the medium-term outlook as little changed, 
and a majority commented that they continued to expect 
inflation to gradually return to the Committee’s 2 per-
cent longer-run objective.  A few participants again 
noted that transitory factors had likely held down infla-
tion earlier this year.  However, several participants ob-
served that survey-based measures of inflation expecta-
tions or market-based measures of inflation compensa-
tion remained low, or that other persistent factors may 
be holding down inflation, which would present chal-
lenges for the Committee in promoting a return of infla-
tion to 2 percent over the medium term.   
Based on their current assessments, almost all partici-
pants expressed the view that it would be appropriate for 
the Committee to raise the target range for the federal 
funds rate 25 basis points at this meeting.  These partic-
ipants agreed that, even after an increase in the target 
range at this meeting, the stance of monetary policy 
would remain accommodative, supporting strong labor 
market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent 
inflation.  A couple of participants did not believe it was 
appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds 
rate at this meeting; these participants suggested that the 
Committee should maintain the target range at 1 to

1¼ percent until the actual rate of inflation had moved  
further toward the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run 
objective or inflation expectations had increased.  They 
judged that leaving the target range at its current level 
would better support an increase in inflation expecta-
tions and thereby increase the likelihood that inflation 
will rise to 2 percent. 
Regarding the determination of the appropriate timing 
and size of future adjustments to the target range for the 
federal funds rate, participants reaffirmed the need to 
continue to assess realized and expected economic con-
ditions.  Most participants reiterated their support for 
continuing a gradual approach to raising the target range, 
noting that this approach helped to balance risks to the 
outlook for economic activity and inflation.  Participants 
discussed several risks that, if realized, could necessitate 
a steeper path of increases in the target range; these risks 
included the possibility that inflation pressures could 
build unduly if output expanded well beyond its maxi-
mum sustainable level, perhaps owing to fiscal stimulus 
or accommodative financial market conditions.  Partici-
pants also discussed risks that could lead to a flatter tra-
jectory for the federal funds rate in the medium term, 
including a failure of actual or expected inflation to 
move up to the Committee’s 2 percent objective.  While 
participants generally saw the risks to the economic out-
look as roughly balanced, they agreed that inflation de-
velopments should be monitored closely.  A few partic-
ipants indicated that they were not comfortable with the 
degree of additional policy tightening through the end of 
2018 implied by the median projections for the federal 
funds rate in the December SEP.  They expressed con-
cern that such a path of increases in the policy rate, while 
gradual, might prove inconsistent with a sustained return 
of inflation to 2 percent, or that the level of the federal 
funds rate might already be near its current neutral value.  
A few other participants mentioned that they saw as ap-
propriate a pace of additional policy tightening through 
the end of 2018 that was somewhat faster than that im-
plied by the December SEP median forecast.  They 
noted that financial conditions had not materially tight-
ened since the removal of monetary policy accommoda-
tion began, that continued low interest rates risked fi-
nancial instability in the future, or that the labor market 
was increasingly tight.  A couple of participants noted 
the need to continue to monitor and evaluate the effects 
of balance sheet normalization on long-term interest 
rates and economic performance. 
Due to the persistent shortfall of inflation from the 
Committee’s 2 percent objective, or the risk that mone-
tary policy could again become constrained by the zero 
lower bound, a few participants suggested that further 

study of potential alternative frameworks for the con-
duct of monetary policy such as price-level targeting or 
nominal GDP targeting could be useful. 

Committee Policy Action 

In their discussion of monetary policy for the period 
ahead, members judged that information received since 
the Committee met in November indicated that the la-
bor market had continued to strengthen and that eco-
nomic activity had been rising at a solid rate.  Averaging 
through hurricane-related fluctuations, job gains had 
been solid, and the unemployment rate had declined fur-
ther.  Household spending had been expanding at a 
moderate rate, and growth in business fixed investment 
had picked up in recent quarters.  On a 12-month basis, 
both overall inflation and inflation for items other than 
food and energy had declined for the year to date and 
were running below 2 percent.  Market-based measures 
of inflation compensation had remained low; survey-
based measures of longer-term inflation expectations 
had changed little, on balance. 
Members acknowledged that hurricane-related disrup-
tions and rebuilding had affected economic activity, em-
ployment, and inflation in recent months but had not 
materially altered the outlook for the national economy.  
They continued to expect that, with gradual adjustments 
in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity 
would expand at a moderate pace and labor market con-
ditions would remain strong.  Members expected infla-
tion on a 12-month basis to remain somewhat below 
2 percent in the near term.  They also expected inflation 
to stabilize around the Committee’s 2 percent objective 
over the medium term, but a couple of members ex-
pressed concern about whether inflation would return to 
2 percent on a sustained basis in the medium term if the 
Committee increased the target range for the federal 
funds rate at the pace that is implied by the medians of 
the projections from the December SEP.  Members saw 
the near-term risks to the economic outlook as roughly 
balanced, but they agreed to monitor inflation develop-
ments closely. 
After assessing current conditions and the outlook for 
economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, nearly 
all members agreed to raise the target range for the fed-
eral funds rate to 1¼ to 1½ percent.  These members 
noted that the stance of monetary policy remains accom-
modative, thereby supporting strong labor market con-
ditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation.  
Two members preferred to leave the target range at 1 to 
1¼ percent, suggesting that the Committee should wait 
to raise the target range until inflation moves up closer

to 2 percent on a sustained basis or inflation expecta-
tions increase. 
Members agreed that the timing and size of future ad-
justments to the target range for the federal funds rate 
would depend on their assessments of realized and ex-
pected economic conditions relative to the Committee’s 
objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent in-
flation.  They noted that their assessments would take 
into account a wide range of information, including 
measures of labor market conditions, indicators of infla-
tion pressures and inflation expectations, and readings 
on financial and international developments.  Members 
agreed that their assessments would also take into ac-
count actual and expected inflation developments rela-
tive to the Committee’s symmetric inflation goal.  Al-
most all members reaffirmed their expectation that eco-
nomic conditions would evolve in a manner that would 
warrant gradual increases in the federal funds rate, and 
that the federal funds rate would be likely to remain, for 
some time, below levels that were expected to prevail in 
the longer run.  Nonetheless, members reiterated that 
the actual path of the federal funds rate would depend 
on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data. 
At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee 
voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank 
of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to 
execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with 
the following domestic policy directive, to be released at 
2:00 p.m.: 
“Effective December 14, 2017, the Federal 
Open Market Committee directs the Desk to 
undertake open market operations as necessary 
to maintain the federal funds rate in a target 
range of 1¼ to 1½ percent, including overnight 
reverse repurchase operations (and reverse re-
purchase operations with maturities of more 
than one day when necessary to accommodate 
weekend, holiday, or similar trading conven-
tions) at an offering rate of 1.25 percent, in 
amounts limited only by the value of Treasury 
securities held outright in the System Open 
Market Account that are available for such op-
erations and by a per-counterparty limit of 
$30 billion per day. 
The Committee directs the Desk to continue 
rolling over at auction the amount of principal 
payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings 
of Treasury securities maturing during Decem-
ber that exceeds $6 billion, and to continue re-
investing in agency mortgage-backed securities 
the amount of principal payments from the 

Federal Reserve’s holdings of agency debt and 
agency mortgage-backed securities received 
during December that exceeds $4 billion.  Ef-
fective in January, the Committee directs the 
Desk to roll over at auction the amount of prin-
cipal payments from the Federal Reserve’s hold-
ings of Treasury securities maturing during each 
calendar month that exceeds $12 billion, and to 
reinvest in agency mortgage-backed securities 
the amount of principal payments from the 
Federal Reserve’s holdings of agency debt and 
agency mortgage-backed securities received 
during each calendar month that exceeds $8 bil-
lion.  Small deviations from these amounts for 
operational reasons are acceptable. 
The Committee also directs the Desk to engage 
in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as 
necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal 
Reserve’s agency mortgage-backed securities 
transactions.” 
The vote also encompassed approval of the statement 
below to be released at 2:00 p.m.: 
“Information received since the Federal Open 
Market Committee met in November indicates 
that the 
labor market has continued to 
strengthen and that economic activity has been 
rising at a solid rate.  Averaging through  
hurricane-related fluctuations, job gains have 
been solid, and the unemployment rate declined 
further.  Household spending has been expand-
ing at a moderate rate, and growth in business 
fixed investment has picked up in recent quar-
ters.  On a 12-month basis, both overall infla-
tion and inflation for items other than food and 
energy have declined this year and are running 
below 2 percent.  Market-based measures of in-
flation compensation remain low; survey-based 
measures of longer-term inflation expectations 
are little changed, on balance. 
Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Com-
mittee seeks to foster maximum employment 
and price stability.  Hurricane-related disrup-
tions and rebuilding have affected economic ac-
tivity, employment, and inflation in recent 
months but have not materially altered the out-
look for the national economy.  Consequently, 
main strong.  Inflation on a 12‐month basis is 
the Committee continues to expect that, with 
gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary 
policy, economic activity will expand at a mod-
erate pace and labor market conditions will re-

expected to remain somewhat below 2 percent 
in the near term but to stabilize around the 
Committee’s 2 percent objective over the me-
dium term.  Near-term risks to the economic 
outlook appear roughly balanced, but the Com-
mittee is monitoring inflation developments 
closely. 
In view of realized and expected labor market 
conditions and inflation, the Committee de-
cided to raise the target range for the federal 
funds rate to 1¼ to 1½ percent.  The stance of 
monetary policy 
remains accommodative, 
thereby supporting strong labor market condi-
tions and a sustained return to 2 percent infla-
tion. 
In determining the timing and size of future ad-
justments to the target range for the federal 
funds rate, the Committee will assess realized 
and expected economic conditions relative to its 
objectives of maximum employment and 2 per-
cent inflation.  This assessment will take into ac-
count a wide range of information, including 
measures of labor market conditions, indicators 
of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, 
and readings on financial and international de-
velopments.  The Committee will carefully 
monitor actual and expected inflation develop-
ments relative to its symmetric inflation goal.  
The Committee expects that economic condi-
tions will evolve in a manner that will warrant 
gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the 
federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some 
time, below levels that are expected to prevail in 
the longer run.  However, the actual path of the 
federal funds rate will depend on the economic 
outlook as informed by incoming data.” 
Voting for this action:  Janet L. Yellen, William C. 
Dudley, Lael Brainard, Patrick Harker, Robert S. Kaplan, 
Jerome H. Powell, and Randal K. Quarles. 
Voting against this action:  Charles L. Evans and Neel 
Kashkari. 

Messrs. Evans and Kashkari dissented because they pre-
ferred to maintain the existing target range for the fed-
eral funds rate at this meeting.   
In Mr. Evans’s view, with inflation continuing to run 
substantially below 2 percent and measures of inflation 
expectations lower than he believed to be consistent 
with a symmetric 2 percent inflation objective, it was im-
portant to pause in the process of policy normalization.  
Leaving the target range at 1 to 1¼ percent for a time 
would better support an increase in inflation expecta-
tions, increase the likelihood that inflation will rise to 
2 percent and perhaps modestly beyond, and thus pro-
vide more support for the symmetry of the Committee’s 
inflation objective.  Such a pause also would better allow 
the Committee time to assess the degree to which earlier 
soft readings on inflation were transitory or more persis-
tent. 
In Mr. Kashkari’s view, while employment growth re-
mained strong, wage growth had not picked up and in-
flation remained notably below the Committee’s 2 per-
cent target.  In addition, the yield curve had flattened as 
long-term rates had not moved higher even though the 
Committee raised the federal funds rate target range.  He 
was concerned that the flattening yield curve was partly 
due to falling longer-term inflation expectations or a 
lower neutral real rate of interest.  He preferred to wait 
for inflation to move closer to 2 percent on a sustained 
basis or for inflation expectations to move up before fur-
ther raising the target range for the federal funds rate. 
To support the Committee’s decision to raise the target 
range for the federal funds rate, the Board of Governors 
voted unanimously to raise the interest rates on required 
and excess reserve balances ¼ percentage point, to 
1½ percent, effective December 14, 2017.  The Board of 
Governors also voted unanimously to approve a ¼ per-
centage point increase in the primary credit rate (dis-
count rate) to 2 percent, effective December 14, 2017.5 
It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee 
would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, January 30–31, 
2018. 
 The meeting adjourned at 10:15 a.m. on 
December 13, 2017. 

5 In taking this action, the Board approved requests submitted 
by the boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of 
Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, At-
lanta, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco.  This vote also 
encompassed approval by the Board of Governors of the es-
tablishment of a 2 percent primary credit rate by the remaining 
Federal Reserve Banks, effective on the later of December 14, 
2017, and the date such Reserve Banks informed the Secretary 

of the Board of such a request.  (Secretary’s note: Subse-
quently, the Federal Reserve Banks of Chicago, St. Louis, and 
Minneapolis were informed by the Secretary of the Board of 
the Board’s approval of their establishment of a primary credit 
rate of 2 percent, effective December 14, 2017.)  The second 
vote of the Board also encompassed approval of the establish-
ment of the interest rates for secondary and seasonal credit 
under the existing formulas for computing such rates.

Summary of Economic Projections

In conjunction with the Federal Open Market Commit-
tee (FOMC) meeting held on December 12–13, 2017, 
meeting participants submitted their projections of the 
most likely outcomes for real gross domestic product 
(GDP) growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for 
each year from 2017 to 2020 and over the longer run.1  
Each participant’s projection was based on information 
available at the time of the meeting, together with his or 
her assessment of appropriate monetary policy—includ-
ing a path for the federal funds rate and its longer-run 
value—and assumptions about other factors likely to af-
fect economic outcomes.  The longer-run projections 
represent each participant’s assessment of the value to 
which each variable would be expected to converge, over 
time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the ab-
sence of further shocks to the economy.2  “Appropriate 
monetary policy” is defined as the future path of policy 
that each participant deems most likely to foster out-
comes for economic activity and inflation that best sat-
isfy his or her individual interpretation of the statutory 
mandate to promote maximum employment and price 
stability. 
All participants who submitted longer-run projections 
expected that, under appropriate monetary policy, 
growth in real GDP in 2018 would be somewhat 
stronger than their individual estimates of its longer-run 
rate.  All participants projected that real GDP growth 
would moderate in 2019, and nearly all predicted that it 
would ease further in 2020; a solid majority of partici-
pants thought that growth in real GDP would be at or 
close to their individual estimates of the economy’s 
longer-run growth rate by 2020.  All participants who 
submitted longer-run projections expected that the un-
employment rate would run below their estimates of its 
longer-run normal level through 2020.  Participants gen-
erally projected that inflation, as measured by the four-
quarter percentage change in the price index for personal 
consumption expenditures (PCE), would step up toward 
the Committee’s 2 percent objective in 2018 and be at or 

close to that objective by 2019.  Most participants indi-
cated that prospective changes in federal tax policy were 
a factor that led them to boost their projections of real 
GDP growth over the next couple of years; some partic-
ipants, however, noted that they had already incorpo-
rated at least some effects of future tax cuts in their Sep-
tember projections.  Several also noted the possibility 
that changes to tax policy could raise the level of poten-
tial GDP in the longer run.3  Table 1 and figure 1 pro-
vide summary statistics for the projections. 
As shown in figure 2, participants generally expected 
that the evolution of the economy relative to their ob-
jectives of maximum employment and 2 percent infla-
tion would likely warrant further gradual increases in the 
federal funds rate.  Compared with the projections they 
submitted in September, some participants raised their 
federal funds rate projections for 2018 and 2019, while 
several others lowered their projections, leaving the me-
dian projection for the federal funds rate in those years 
unchanged; the median projection for 2020 was slightly 
higher, and the median projection for the longer-run 
normal level of the federal funds rate was unchanged.  
Nearly all participants saw it as likely to be appropriate 
for the federal funds rate to rise above their estimates of 
its longer-run normal level at some point during the 
forecast period.  Participants generally noted several 
sources of uncertainty about the future course of the 
federal funds rate, including the details of potential 
changes in tax policy, how those changes would affect 
the economy, and the range of factors influencing infla-
tion over the medium term. 
In general, participants viewed the uncertainty attached 
to their economic projections as broadly similar to the 
average of the past 20 years, and all participants saw the 
uncertainty associated with their projections for real 
GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as 
essentially unchanged from September.  As in Septem-

1 Four members of the Board of Governors were in office at 
the time of the December 2017 meeting, the same number as 
in September 2017.  However, since the September meeting, 
one member, Stanley Fischer, resigned from the Board and 
another, Randal K. Quarles, joined.  The incoming president 
of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond is scheduled to as-
sume office on January 1, 2018; First Vice President Mark L. 

Mullinix submitted economic projections at this meeting as he 
did in September. 
2 One participant did not submit longer-run projections for 
real output growth, the unemployment rate, or the federal 
funds rate. 
3 Participants completed their submissions for the Summary 
of Economic Projections before the reconciliation of the 
House and Senate tax bills in the Congress.

ticipant’s judgment of the midpoint of the appropriate target range for the federal funds rate or the appropriate target
level for the federal funds rate at the end of the speciﬁed calendar year or over the longer run. One participant did not
submit longer-run pro jections for the federal funds rate.

jections for economic growth, the unemployment rate, 
and inflation as broadly balanced. 

The Outlook for Economic Activity 

The median of participants’ projections for the growth 
rate of real GDP for 2018, conditional on their individ-
ual assessments of appropriate monetary policy, was 
2.5 percent, the same as for 2017.  The median projec-
tions for GDP growth in 2019 and 2020 were slightly 
lower, at 2.1 and 2.0 percent, respectively.  Compared 
with the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) from 
September, the median of the projections for real GDP 
growth for 2018 was notably higher, while the medians 
for real GDP growth for 2019 and 2020 were modestly 
higher.  The median of projections for the longer-run 
normal rate of real GDP growth remained at 1.8 percent.  
Most participants pointed to changes in tax policy as 
likely to provide some boost to real GDP growth over 
the forecast period; in September, fewer than half of the 
participants incorporated prospective tax policy changes 
in their projections.  Several participants indicated that 
they had marked up their estimates of the magnitude of 
tax cuts, relative to their assumptions in September.   
The medians of projections for the unemployment rate 
in the fourth quarter of both 2018 and 2019 were 
3.9 percent, 0.2 percentage point below the medians 
from September and about ¾ percentage point below 
the median assessment of its longer-run normal level.  
The median projection for the unemployment rate 
ticked up slightly to 4.0 percent in 2020. 
Figures 3.A and 3.B show the distributions of partici-
pants’ projections for real GDP growth and the unem-
ployment rate from 2017 to 2020 and in the longer run.  
The distribution of individual projections for real GDP 
growth for 2018 shifted up, with more than half of the 
participants now expecting real GDP growth of 2.5 per-
cent or more and none seeing it below 2.2 percent.  The 
distribution of projected real GDP growth in 2019 and 
2020 also shifted up, albeit only slightly.  The distribu-
tion for the longer-run normal rate of GDP growth was 
little changed from September.  The distributions of in-
dividual projections for the unemployment rate in 2018 
and 2019 shifted down relative to those in September, 
broadly consistent with the changes in the distributions 
for real GDP growth. 

The Outlook for Inflation 

The median of projections for headline PCE price infla-
tion was 1.9 percent in 2018 and 2 percent in 2019 and 
2020, the same as in the September SEP.  Most partici-
pants anticipated that inflation would continue to run a 

bit below 2 percent in 2018, and only one participant ex-
pected inflation above 2 percent that year.  A majority of 
participants projected that inflation would be equal to 
the Committee’s objective in 2019 and 2020.  Several 
participants projected that inflation would slightly ex-
ceed 2 percent in 2019 or 2020.  The medians of projec-
tions for core PCE price inflation over the 2018–20 pe-
riod were the same as those for headline inflation. 
Figures 3.C and 3.D provide information on the distri-
butions of participants’ views about the outlook for in-
flation.  On the whole, the distributions of projections 
for headline PCE price inflation and core PCE price in-
flation beyond 2017 were little changed from September. 

Appropriate Monetary Policy 

Figure 3.E provides the distribution of participants’ 
judgments regarding the appropriate target—or mid-
point of the target range—for the federal funds rate at 
the end of each year from 2017 to 2020 and in the longer 
run.  Overall, the distributions differed in only small 
ways from those reported in the September SEP.  There 
was a moderate reduction in the dispersion of the distri-
bution for 2020 and for the longer run; some of the 
lower-end projections for those horizons from the Sep-
tember SEP were revised up in the current projections. 
The median projection of the year-end federal funds rate 
continued to rise gradually over the 2018–20 period.  
The median projection for the end of 2018 was 2.13 per-
cent; the medians of the projections were 2.69 percent at 
the end of 2019 and 3.07 percent at the end of 2020.  
Nearly all participants projected that it would likely be 
appropriate for the federal funds rate to rise above their 
individual estimates of the longer-run normal rate at 
some point over the forecast period.  Compared with 
their projections prepared for the September SEP, a few 
participants raised their projections for the federal funds 
rate in the longer run and one lowered it; the median was 
unchanged at 2.75 percent. 
In discussing their projections, many participants once 
again expressed the view that the appropriate trajectory 
of the federal funds rate over the next few years would 
likely involve gradual increases.  This view was predi-
cated on several factors, including a judgment that the 
neutral real interest rate was currently low and would 
move up only slowly, as well as the balancing of risks 
associated with, among other things, the possibility that 
inflation pressures could build if the economy expands 
well beyond its long-run sustainable level, and the possi-
bility that the forces depressing inflation could prove to 
be more persistent than currently anticipated.  As always, 
the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on

Uncertainty and Risks 

In assessing the path for the federal funds rate that, in 
their view, is likely to be appropriate, FOMC participants 
take account of the range of possible economic out-
comes, the likelihood of those outcomes, and the poten-
tial benefits and costs should they occur.  As a reference, 
table 2 provides a measure of forecast uncertainty, based 
on the forecast errors of various private and government 
forecasts over the past 20 years, for real GDP growth, 
the unemployment rate, and total consumer price infla-
tion.  That measure is incorporated graphically in the top 
panels of figures 4.A, 4.B, and 4.C, which display “fan 
charts” plotting the median SEP projections for the 
three variables surrounded by symmetric confidence in-
tervals derived from the forecast errors presented in ta-
ble 2.  If the degree of uncertainty attending these pro-
jections is similar to the typical magnitude of past fore-
cast errors and the risks around the projections are 
broadly balanced, future outcomes of these variables 
would have about a 70 percent probability of occurring 
within these confidence intervals.  For all three variables, 
this measure of projection uncertainty is substantial and 
generally increases as the forecast horizon lengthens. 
Participants’ assessments of the level of uncertainty sur-
rounding their economic projections are shown in the 
bottom-left panels of figures 4.A, 4.B, and 4.C.  Nearly 
all participants viewed the degree of uncertainty attached 
to their economic projections about GDP growth, the 
unemployment rate, and inflation as broadly similar to 
the average of the past 20 years, a view that was essen-
tially unchanged from September.4  About half of the 
participants who commented on this topic suggested 
that uncertainties about the details of the pending tax 
legislation had raised their assessment of uncertainty for 
GDP growth, albeit not by enough to tip their assess-
ments into the higher-than-average category. 
Because the fan charts are constructed to be symmetric 
around the median projection, they do not reflect any 
asymmetries in the balance of risks that participants may 
see in their economic projections.  Accordingly, partici-
pants’ assessments of the balance of risks to their eco-
nomic projections are shown in the bottom-right panels 
of figures 4.A, 4.B, and 4.C.  As in September, most par-
ticipants judged the risks to their projections of real 
GDP growth, the unemployment rate, headline inflation 
and core inflation as broadly balanced—in other words,

NOTE:  Error ranges shown are measured as plus or minus the 
root mean squared error of projections for 1997 through 2016 that 
were released in the winter by various private and government fore-
casters.  As described in the box “Forecast Uncertainty,” under certain 
assumptions, there is about a 70 percent probability that actual out-
comes for real GDP, unemployment, consumer prices, and the federal 
funds rate will be in ranges implied by the average size of projection 
errors made in the past.  For more information, see David Reifschnei-
der and Peter Tulip (2017), “Gauging the Uncertainty of the Economic 
Outlook Using Historical Forecasting Errors: The Federal Reserve’s 
Approach,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2017-020

February), www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/feds/2017/files/

forecasts.  Projections are percent changes on a fourth quarter to 
fourth quarter basis.

as broadly consistent with a symmetric fan chart.  The 
balance of risks to the economic outlook shifted slightly 
in the direction of strength, with two more participants 
seeing upside risks to growth in real GDP than in Sep-
tember and one more seeing risks to the unemployment 
rate as weighted to the downside.  In addition, one more 
participant than before saw risks to inflation as weighted 
to the upside. 
Participants’ assessments of the future path of the fed-
eral funds rate consistent with appropriate policy are also 
subject to considerable uncertainty.  Because the Com-
mittee adjusts the federal funds rate in response to actual 
and prospective developments over time in real GDP 
growth, unemployment, and inflation, uncertainty sur-
rounding the projected path for the funds rate im-
portantly reflects the uncertainties about the path for 
those key economic variables.  Figure 5 provides a 
graphical representation of this uncertainty, plotting the 
median SEP projection for the federal funds rate sur-
rounded by confidence intervals derived from the results 
presented in table 2.  As with the macroeconomic varia-
bles, forecast uncertainty is substantial and increases for 
longer horizons. 

4 At the end of this summary, the box “Forecast Uncertainty” 
discusses the sources and interpretation of uncertainty in the 
economic forecasts and explains the approach used to assess 

the uncertainty and risks attending the participants’ projec-
tions.

Note: The blue and red lines are based on actual values and median pro jected values, respectively, of the Com-
mittee’s target for the federal funds rate at the end of the year indicated. The actual values are the midpoint of the
target range; the median pro jected values are based on either the midpoint of the target range or the target level.
The conﬁdence interval around the median pro jected values is based on root mean squared errors of various private
and government forecasts made over the previous 20 years. The conﬁdence interval is not strictly consistent with the
pro jections for the federal funds rate, primarily because these pro jections are not forecasts of the likeliest outcomes for
the federal funds rate, but rather pro jections of participants’ individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy.
Still, historical forecast errors provide a broad sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate
generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy
that may be appropriate to oﬀset the eﬀects of shocks to the economy.
The conﬁdence interval is assumed to be symmetric except when it is truncated at zero—the bottom of the lowest
target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted in the past by the Committee. This truncation would
not be intended to indicate the likelihood of the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policy
accommodation if doing so was judged appropriate. In such situations, the Committee could also employ other tools,
including forward guidance and large-scale asset purchases, to provide additional accommodation. Because current
conditions may diﬀer from those that prevailed, on average, over the previous 20 years, the width and shape of the
conﬁdence interval estimated on the basis of the historical forecast errors may not reﬂect FOMC participants’ current
assessments of the uncertainty and risks around their pro jections.
* The conﬁdence interval is derived from forecasts of the average level of short-term interest rates in the fourth
quarter of the year indicated; more information about these data is available in table 2. The shaded area encompasses
less than a 70 percent conﬁdence interval if the conﬁdence interval has been truncated at zero.

Summary of Economic Projections of the Meeting of December 12–13, 2017Page 15_____________________________________________________________________________________________Forecast Uncertainty 

The economic projections provided by the members of 
the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal 
Reserve Banks inform discussions of monetary policy among 
policymakers and can aid public understanding of the basis 
for policy actions.  Considerable uncertainty attends these 
projections, however.  The economic and statistical models 
and relationships used to help produce economic forecasts 
are necessarily imperfect descriptions of the real world, and 
the future path of the economy can be affected by myriad 
unforeseen developments and events.  Thus, in setting the 
stance of monetary policy, participants consider not only 
what appears to be the most likely economic outcome as em-
bodied in their projections, but also the range of alternative 
possibilities, the likelihood of their occurring, and the poten-
tial costs to the economy should they occur. 
Table 2 summarizes the average historical accuracy of a 
range of forecasts, including those reported in past Monetary 
Policy Reports and those prepared by the Federal Reserve 
Board’s staff in advance of meetings of the Federal Open 
Market Committee (FOMC).  The projection error ranges 
shown in the table illustrate the considerable uncertainty as-
sociated with economic forecasts.  For example, suppose a 
participant projects that real gross domestic product (GDP) 
and total consumer prices will rise steadily at annual rates of, 
respectively, 3 percent and 2 percent.  If the uncertainty at-
tending those projections is similar to that experienced in the 
past and the risks around the projections are broadly bal-
anced, the numbers reported in table 2 would imply a prob-
ability of about 70 percent that actual GDP would expand 
within a range of 2.2 to 3.8 percent in the current year, 1.3 to 
4.7 percent in the second year, 0.9 to 5.1 percent in the third 
year, and 0.8 to 5.2 percent in the fourth year.  The corre-
sponding 70 percent confidence intervals for overall infla-
tion would be 1.8 to 2.2 percent in the current year, 1.0 to 
3.0 percent in the second year, 0.9 to 3.1 percent in the third 
year, and 1.0 to 3.0 percent in the fourth year.  Figures 4.A 
through 4.C illustrate these confidence bounds in “fan 
charts” that are symmetric and centered on the medians of 
FOMC participants’ projections for GDP growth, the unem-
ployment rate, and inflation.  However, in some instances, 
the risks around the projections may not be symmetric.  In 
particular, the unemployment rate cannot be negative; fur-
thermore, the risks around a particular projection might be 
tilted to either the upside or the downside, in which case the 
corresponding fan chart would be asymmetrically positioned 
around the median projection. 
Because current conditions may differ from those that 
prevailed, on average, over history, participants provide 
judgments as to whether the uncertainty attached to their 
projections of each economic variable is greater than, smaller 
than, or broadly similar to typical levels of forecast uncer-
tainty seen in the past 20 years, as presented in table 2 and 
reflected in the widths of the confidence intervals shown in 
the top panels of figures 4.A through 4.C.  Participants’ cur- 

rent assessments of the uncertainty surrounding their projec-
tions are summarized in the bottom-left panels of those fig-
ures.  Participants also provide judgments as to whether the 
risks to their projections are weighted to the upside, are 
weighted to the downside, or are broadly balanced.  That is, 
while the symmetric historical fan charts shown in the top 
panels of figures 4.A through 4.C imply that the risks to par-
ticipants’ projections are balanced, participants may judge that 
there is a greater risk that a given variable will be above rather 
than below their projections.  These judgments are summa-
rized in the lower-right panels of figures 4.A through 4.C. 
As with real activity and inflation, the outlook for the 
future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable 
uncertainty.  This uncertainty arises primarily because each 
participant’s assessment of the appropriate stance of mone-
tary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real ac-
tivity and inflation over time.  If economic conditions evolve 
in an unexpected manner, then assessments of the appropri-
ate setting of the federal funds rate would change from that 
point forward.  The final line in table 2 shows the error ranges 
for forecasts of short-term interest rates.  They suggest that 
the historical confidence intervals associated with projections 
of the federal funds rate are quite wide.  It should be noted, 
however, that these confidence intervals are not strictly con-
sistent with the projections for the federal funds rate, as these 
projections are not forecasts of the most likely quarterly out-
comes but rather are projections of participants’ individual as-
sessments of appropriate monetary policy and are on an end-
of-year basis.  However, the forecast errors should provide a 
sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal 
funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeco-
nomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary 
policy that would be appropriate to offset the effects of 
shocks to the economy. 
If at some point in the future the confidence interval 
around the federal funds rate were to extend below zero, it 
would be truncated at zero for purposes of the fan chart 
shown in figure 5; zero is the bottom of the lowest target 
range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted by the 
Committee in the past.  This approach to the construction of 
the federal funds rate fan chart would be merely a convention; 
it would not have any implications for possible future policy 
decisions regarding the use of negative interest rates to pro-
vide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so 
were appropriate.  In such situations, the Committee could 
also employ other tools, including forward guidance and asset 
purchases, to provide additional accommodation. 
While figures 4.A through 4.C provide information on 
the uncertainty around the economic projections, figure 1 
provides information on the range of views across FOMC 
participants.  A comparison of figure 1 with figures 4.A 
through 4.C shows that the dispersion of the projections 
across participants is much smaller than the average forecast 
errors over the past 20 years.
